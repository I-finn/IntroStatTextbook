<p>Focusing now on Statistical Inference for <strong>categorical data</strong>, we will revisit many of the foundational aspects of hypothesis testing from Chapter <a href="inference-foundations.html#inference-foundations">5</a>.</p>
<p>The three data structures we detail are one binary variable, summarized using a single proportion; two binary variables, summarized using a difference of two proportions; and two categorical variables, summarized using a two-way table.
When appropriate, each of the data structures will be analyzed using the three methods from Chapter <a href="inference-foundations.html#inference-foundations">5</a>: randomization test, bootstrapping, and mathematical models.</p>
As we build on the inferential ideas, we will visit new foundational concepts in statistical inference.
For example, we will cover the conditions for when a normal model is appropriate; the two different error rates in hypothesis testing; and choosing the confidence level for a confidence interval.

<div id="single-prop" class="section level2" number="6.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> One proportion</h2>
<p>We encountered inference methods for a single proportion
in Chapter <a href="inference-foundations.html#inference-foundations">5</a>,
exploring point estimates, confidence intervals,
and hypothesis tests.
In this section, we’ll do a review of these topics
and also how to choose an appropriate sample size
when collecting data for single proportion contexts.</p>
<p>Note that there is only one variable being measured in a study which focuses on one proportion.
For each observational unit, the single variable is measured as either a success or failure (e.g., “surgical complication” vs. “no surgical complication”).
Because the nature of the research question at hand focuses on only a single variable, there is not a way to randomize the variable across a different (explanatory) variable.
For this reason, we will not use randomization as an analysis tool when focusing on a single proportion. Instead, we will apply bootstrapping techniques to test a given hypothesis, and we will also revisit the associated mathematical models.</p>
<div id="one-prop-null-boot" class="section level3" number="6.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.1</span> Bootstrap test for <span class="math inline">\(H_0: p = p_0\)</span></h3>
<p>The bootstrap simulation concept when <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is true is similar to the ideas used
in the case studies presented in
Section <a href="inference-foundations.html#boot-ci">5.2</a> where we bootstrapped without an assumption about <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. Because we will be testing a hypothesized value of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> (referred to as <span class="math inline">\(p_0\)</span>), the bootstrap simulation for hypothesis testing has a fantastic advantage that it can be used for any sample size (a huge benefit for small samples, a nice alternative for large samples).</p>
<p>We expand on the medical consultant example, see Section <a href="inference-foundations.html#sec-med-consult">5.2.1</a>, where instead of finding an interval estimate for the true complication rate, we work to test a specific research claim.</p>
<div id="observed-data" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Observed data</h5>
<p>Recall the set-up for the example:</p>
<p>People providing an organ for donation sometimes seek the help of a special “medical consultant”. These consultants assist the patient in all aspects of the surgery, with the goal of reducing the possibility of complications during the medical procedure and recovery. Patients might choose a consultant based in part on the historical complication rate of the consultant’s clients. One consultant tried to attract patients by noting the average complication rate for liver donor surgeries in the US is about 10%, but her clients have only had 3 complications in the 62 liver donor surgeries she has facilitated. She claims this is strong evidence that her work meaningfully contributes to reducing complications (and therefore she should be hired!).</p>

<div class="example">
<p>Using the data, is it possible to assess the consultant’s claim that her complication rate is less than 10%?</p>
<hr />
<p>No. The claim is that there is a causal connection, but the data are observational. Patients who hire this medical consultant may have lower complication rates for other reasons.</p>
While it is not possible to assess this causal claim, it is still possible to test for an association using these data. For this question we ask, could the low complication rate of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = 0.048\)</span> be due to chance?
</div>

<div class="guidedpractice">
Write out hypotheses in both plain and statistical language to test for the association between the consultant’s work and the true complication rate, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, for the consultant’s clients.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a>
</div>
<p>Because, as it turns out, the conditions of working with the normal distribution are not met (see Section <a href="inference-cat.html#one-prop-norm">6.1.2</a>), the uncertainty associated with the sample proportion should not be modeled using the normal distribution. However, we would still like to assess the hypotheses from the previous Guided Practice in absence of the normal framework. To do so, we need to evaluate the possibility of a sample value (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>) as far below the null value, <span class="math inline">\(p_0=0.10\)</span> as what was observed. The deviation of the sample value from the hypothesized parameter is usually quantified with a p-value.</p>
<p>The p-value is computed based on the null distribution, which is the distribution of the test statistic if the null hypothesis is true. Supposing the null hypothesis is true, we can compute the p-value by identifying the chance of observing a test statistic that favors the alternative hypothesis at least as strongly as the observed test statistic. Here we will use a bootstrap simulation to measure the p-value.</p>
</div>
<div id="variability-of-the-statistic" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Variability of the statistic</h5>
<p>We want to identify the sampling distribution of the test statistic (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>) if the null hypothesis was true. In other words, we want to see how the sample proportion changes due to chance alone. Then we plan to use this information to decide whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>Under the null hypothesis, 10% of liver donors have complications during or after surgery. Suppose this rate was really no different for the consultant’s clients (for <em>all</em> the consultant’s clients, not just the 62 previously measured). If this was the case, we could <em>simulate</em> 62 clients to get a sample proportion for the complication rate from the null distribution. Simulating observations using a hypothesized null parameter value is often called a <strong>parametric bootstrap simulation</strong>.</p>
<p>Similar to the process described in Section <a href="inference-foundations.html#boot-ci">5.2</a>, each client can be simulated using a bag of marbles with 10% red marbles and 90% white marbles.
Sampling a marble from the bag (with 10% red marbles) is one way of simulating whether a patient has a complication <em>if the true complication rate is 10%</em> for the data. If we select 62 marbles and then compute the proportion of patients with complications in the simulation, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{sim}\)</span>, then the resulting sample proportion is exactly a sample from the null distribution.</p>
<p>An undergraduate student was paid $2 to complete this simulation. There were 5 simulated cases with a complication and 57 simulated cases without a complication, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{sim} = 5/62 = 0.081\)</span>.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>Is this one simulation enough to determine whether or not we should reject the null hypothesis?</p>
<hr />
No. To assess the hypotheses, we need to see a distribution of many <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{sim}\)</span>, not just a <em>single</em> draw from this sampling distribution.
</div>
</div>
<div id="observed-statistic-vs.-null-statistics" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Observed statistic vs. null statistics</h4>
<p>One simulation isn’t enough to get a sense of the null distribution; many simulation studies are needed. Roughly 10,000 seems sufficient. However, paying someone to simulate 10,000 studies by hand is a waste of time and money. Instead, simulations are typically programmed into a computer, which is much more efficient.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="inference-cat.html#fig:nullDistForPHatIfLiverTransplantConsultantIsNotHelpful">6.1</a> shows the results of 10,000 simulated studies. The proportions that are equal to or less than <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}=0.048\)</span> are shaded. The shaded areas represent sample proportions under the null distribution that provide at least as much evidence as <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> favoring the alternative hypothesis. There were 1222 simulated sample proportions with <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{sim} \leq 0.048\)</span>. We use these to construct the null distribution’s left-tail area and find the p-value:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\text{left tail area }\label{estOfPValueBasedOnSimulatedNullForSingleProportion}
	&amp;= \frac{\text{Number of observed simulations with }\hat{p}_{sim}\leq\text{ 0.048}}{10000}
\end{align}\]</span>
Of the 10,000 simulated <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{sim}\)</span>, 1222 were equal to or smaller than <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>. Since the hypothesis test is one-sided, the estimated p-value is equal to this tail area: 0.1222.</p>

<p><strong>Null distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> with bootstrap simulation</strong></p>
Regardless of the statistial method chosen, the p-value is always derived by analyzing the null distribution of the test statistic. The normal model poorly approximates the null distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> when the success-failure condition is not satisfied. As a substitute, we can generate the null distribution using simulated sample proportions and use this distribution to compute the tail area, i.e., the p-value.
</div>
<p>In the previous Guided Practice, the p-value is <em>estimated</em>.
It is not exact because the simulated null distribution itself is not exact, only a close approximation.
An exact p-value can be generated using the binomial distribution, but that method will not be covered in this text.</p>
<!--
#### Generating the exact null distribution and p-value  {-} {#exactNullDistributionUsingBinomialModel}

The number of successes in $n$ independent cases can be described using the binomial model, which was introduced in Section \ref{binomialModel}. Recall that the probability of observing exactly $k$ successes is given by
\begin{align} \label{binomialEquationShownForFindingNullDistributionInSmallSamplePropTest}
P(k\text{ successes}) = {n\choose k} p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}
\end{align}
where $p$ is the true probability of success. The expression ${n\choose k}$ is read as \emph{$n$ choose $k$}, and the exclamation points represent factorials. For instance, $3!$ is equal to $3\times 2\times 1=6$, $4!$ is equal to $4\times 3\times 2\times 1 = 24$, and so on (see Section \ref{binomialModel}).

The tail area of the null distribution is computed by adding up the probability in Equation \eqref{binomialEquationShownForFindingNullDistributionInSmallSamplePropTest} for each $k$ that provides at least as strong of evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis as the data. If the hypothesis test is one-sided, then the p-value is represented by a single tail area. If the test is two-sided, compute the single tail area and double it to get the p-value, just as we have done in the past.

\begin{example}{Compute the exact p-value to check the consultant's claim that her clients' complication rate is below 105.}
Exactly $k=3$ complications were observed in the $n=62$ cases cited by the consultant. Since we are testing against the 10% national average, our null hypothesis is $p=0.10$. We can compute the p-value by adding up the cases where there are 3 or fewer complications:
\begin{align*}
\text{p-value}
	&= \sum_{j=0}^{3} {n\choose j} p^{j}(1-p)^{n-j} \\
	&= \sum_{j=0}^{3} {62\choose j} 0.1^{j}(1-0.1)^{62-j} \\
	&= {62\choose 0} 0.1^{0}(1-0.1)^{62-0} +
		{62\choose 1} 0.1^{1}(1-0.1)^{62-1} \\
	& \qquad + {62\choose 2} 0.1^{2}(1-0.1)^{62-2} +
		{62\choose 3} 0.1^{3}(1-0.1)^{62-3} \\
	&= 0.0015 + 0.0100 + 0.0340 + 0.0755 \\
	&= 0.1210
\end{align*}
This exact p-value is very close to the p-value based on the simulations (0.1222), and we come to the same conclusion. We do not reject the null hypothesis, and there is not statistically significant evidence to support the association.

If it were plotted, the exact null distribution would look almost identical to the simulated null distribution shown in Figure \ref{nullDistForPHatIfLiverTransplantConsultantIsNotHelpful} on page \pageref{nullDistForPHatIfLiverTransplantConsultantIsNotHelpful}.

<div id="conditions" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Conditions</h4>
<p>In Section <a href="inference-foundations.html#normalDist">5.3.2</a>, we introduced the normal distribution and showed how it can be used as a mathematical model to describe the variability of a statistic.
There are conditions under which a sample proportion <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> is well modeled using a normal distribution.
When the sample observations
are independent and the sample size is sufficiently
large, the normal model will describe the variability quite well; when the observations violate the conditions, the normal model can be inaccurate</p>

<div class="onebox">
<p><strong>Sampling distribution of
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span></strong></p>
<p>The sampling distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> based on
a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> from a population with a true
proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is nearly normal when:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The sample’s observations are independent,
e.g., are from a simple random sample.</li>
<li>We expected to see at least 10 successes and
10 failures in the sample, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(np\geq10\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(n(1-p)\geq10\)</span>.
This is called the <strong>success-failure condition</strong>.</li>
</ol>
When these conditions are met, then the sampling
distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> is nearly normal with mean
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and standard error of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(SE = \sqrt{\frac{\ p(1-p)\ }{n}}\)</span>.
</div>
<p>
</p>
<p>Typically we don’t know the true proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>,
so we substitute some value to check conditions
and estimate the standard error.
For confidence intervals, the sample proportion
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> is used to check the success-failure condition
and compute the standard error.
For hypothesis tests, typically the null value –
that is, the proportion claimed in the null hypothesis –
is used in place of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>The independence condition is a more nuanced requirement.
When it isn’t met, it is important to understand how and why
it isn’t met.
For example, there exist no statistical methods available to truly correct the inherent biases of data from a convenience sample.
On the other hand, if we took a cluster sample
(see Section <a href="#samp-methods"><strong>??</strong></a>), the observations wouldn’t be independent, but suitable statistical methods are available for analyzing the data (but they are beyond the scope of even most second or third courses
in statistic).</p>

<div class="example">
<p>In the examples based on large sample theory, we modeled <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> using the normal distribution. Why is this not appropriate for the case study on the medical consultant?</p>
<hr />
The independence assumption may be reasonable if each of the surgeries is from a different surgical team. However, the success-failure condition is not satisfied. Under the null hypothesis, we would anticipate seeing <span class="math inline">\(62\times 0.10=6.2\)</span> complications, not the 10 required for the normal approximation.
</div>
<p>While this book is scoped to well-constrained statistical
problems, do remember that this is just the first
book in what is a large library of statistical methods that
are suitable for a very wide range of data and contexts.</p>

<h4>Confidence interval for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span></h4>
<p></p>
<p>A confidence interval provides a range of

normal distribution, the confidence interval
for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> takes the form
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}

<p>We have seen <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> to be the sample proportion. The value <span class="math inline">\(z^{\star}\)</span> determines the confidence level (previously set to be 1.96) and will be discussed in detail in the examples following.

<div class="onebox">
<p><strong>Standard Error of one proportion, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span></strong></p>

<h4>Changing the confidence level</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Suppose we want to consider confidence intervals where the confidence level is somewhat higher than 95%: perhaps we would like a confidence level of 99%. Think back to the analogy about trying to catch a fish: if we want to be more sure that we will catch the fish, we should use a wider net. To create a 99% confidence level, we must also widen our 95% interval. On the other hand, if we want an interval with lower confidence, such as 90%, we could make our original 95% interval slightly slimmer.</p>
<p>The 95% confidence interval structure provides guidance in how to make intervals with new confidence levels. Below is a general 95% confidence interval for a point estimate that comes from a nearly normal distribution:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\text{point estimate}\ \pm\ 1.96\times SE
\end{eqnarray}\]</span>
There are three components to this interval: the point estimate, “1.96”, and the standard error. The choice of <span class="math inline">\(1.96\times SE\)</span> was based on capturing 95% of the data since the estimate is within 1.96 standard errors of the true value about 95% of the time. The choice of 1.96 corresponds to a 95% confidence level.</p>

<p>To create a 99% confidence interval, change 1.96 in the 95% confidence interval formula to be <span class="math inline">\(2.58\)</span>. The previous Guided Practice highlights that 99% of the time a normal random variable will be within 2.58 standard deviations of its mean. This approach – using the Z scores in the normal model to compute confidence levels – is appropriate when the point estimate is associated with a normal distribution and we can properly compute the standard error. Thus, the formula for a 99% confidence interval is:</p>

In both the one-sided or two-sided setting, the conclusion is somewhat unsatisfactory because there is no conclusion.

When collecting data, we choose a sample size suitable
for the purpose of the study. 
You might agree that the following interval estimate would not be particularly useful: a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of liver transplants with complications is between 0 and 1.
Often times "suitable for the study" means choosing a sample size large
enough that the **margin of error**\index{margin of error} --
which is the part we add and subtract from the point
estimate in a confidence interval --
is sufficiently small that the result is useful.
For example, our task might be to find a sample size
$n$ so that the sample proportion is within $\pm 0.04$
of the actual proportion in a 95% confidence interval.

<!--
% For example, the margin of error for a point estimate using 95% confidence can be written as $1.96\times SE$. We set up a general equation to represent the problem:
%\begin{align*}
%ME = z^{\star} \times SE \leq m
%\end{align*}
%where $ME$ represented the actual margin of error and $z^{\star}$ was chosen to correspond to the confidence level. The standard error formula is specified to correspond to the particular setting. For instance, in the case of means, the standard error was given as $\sigma / \sqrt{n}$. In the case of a single proportion, we use $\sqrt{p(1-p) / n\ }$ for the standard error.

    How big of a sample is required to ensure the

    95% confidence level?

---
      
  The margin of error for a sample proportion is
  \begin{align*}
  z^{\star} \sqrt{\frac{p (1 - p)}{n}}
  \end{align*}
  Our goal is to find the smallest sample size $n$
  so that this margin of error is smaller than $0.04$.
  For a 95% confidence level, the value $z^{\star}$
  corresponds to 1.96:
  \begin{align*}
  1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \ < \ 0.04
  \end{align*}
  There are two unknowns in the equation: $p$ and $n$.
  If we have an estimate of $p$, perhaps from a prior
  survey, we could enter in that value and solve for $n$.
  If we have no such estimate, we must use some other
  value for $p$.
  It turns out that the margin of error is largest
  when $p$ is 0.5, so we typically use this
  \emph{worst case value} if no estimate of the
  proportion is available:
  \begin{align*}
	1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{n}} &\ < \ 0.04 \\
	1.96^2\times \frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{n} &\ < \ 0.04^2 \\
	1.96^2\times \frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{0.04^2} &\ < \ n \\
	600.25 &\ < \  n
  \end{align*}
  We would need over 600.25 participants, which means
  we need 601 participants or more, to ensure the
  sample proportion is within 0.04 of the true proportion
  with 95% confidence.</div>\EndKnitrBlock{example}

The quality control team has monitored the last three

6.2% of the second model,
and 1.3% of the third model.
The manager would like to examine enough tires
to estimate the failure rate of the new tire model
to within about 1% with a 90% confidence level.
There are three different failure rates to choose from.
Perform the sample size computation for each separately,
and identify three sample sizes to consider.^[For a 90% confidence interval, $z^{\star} = 1.65$,
  and since an estimate of the proportion 0.017 is available,
  we'll use it in the margin of error formula:
  \begin{align*}
  1.65\times \sqrt{\frac{0.017(1-0.017)}{n}} &\ < \ 0.01

  be sufficient.

  A similar computation can be accomplished using 0.062

  proportions results in minimum sample sizes of 1584

<h4>Observed data</h4>
<p>We consider a study on a new malaria vaccine
called PfSPZ.
In this study, volunteer patients were randomized
into one of two experiment groups:
14 patients received an experimental vaccine
or 6 patients received a placebo vaccine.
Nineteen weeks later, all 20 patients were exposed
to a drug-sensitive malaria virus strain;
the motivation of using a drug-sensitive strain
of virus here is for ethical considerations,
allowing any infections to be treated effectively.
The results are summarized in
Table <a href="inference-cat.html#tab:malaria-vaccine-20-exp-summary">6.1</a>,
where 9 of the 14 treatment patients remained free
of signs of infection while all of the 6 patients
in the control group patients showed some baseline
signs of infection.</p>

<div class="guidedpractice">
Is this an observational study or an experiment?
What implications does the study type have on what can
be inferred from the results?<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a>
</div>
<p>In this study, a smaller proportion of patients
who received the vaccine showed signs of an infection
(35.7% versus 100%).
However, the sample is very small,
and it is unclear whether the difference provides
<em>convincing evidence</em> that the vaccine is
effective.</p>
<!--
<div class="example">
<p>Data scientists are sometimes called upon to evaluate the strength of evidence. When looking at the rates of infection for patients in the two groups in this study, what comes to mind as we try to determine whether the data show convincing evidence of a real difference?</p>
<hr />
<p>The observed infection rates (35.7% for the treatment group versus 100% for the control group) suggest the vaccine may be effective. However, we cannot be sure if the observed difference represents the vaccine’s efficacy or is just from random chance. Generally there is a little bit of fluctuation in sample data, and we wouldn’t expect the sample proportions to be <em>exactly</em> equal, even if the truth was that the infection rates were independent of getting the vaccine. Additionally, with such small samples, perhaps it’s common to observe such large differences when we randomly split a group due to chance alone!</p>
</div>

The previous malaria example
is a reminder that the observed outcomes in the data
sample may not perfectly reflect the true relationships
between variables since there is \term{random noise}.
While the observed difference in rates of infection
is large, the sample size for the study is small,
making it unclear if this observed difference represents
efficacy of the vaccine or whether it is simply due to
chance.
We label these two competing claims, $H_0$ and $H_A$,
which are spoken as ``H-nought'' and ``H-A'':
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$:] \textbf{Independence model.}
    The variables \var{treatment} and \var{outcome}
    are independent.
    They have no relationship, and the observed difference
    between the proportion of patients who developed
    an infection in the two groups, 64.3%,
    was due to chance.
\item[$H_A$:] \textbf{Alternative model.}
    The variables are \emph{not} independent.
    The difference in infection rates of
    64.3%
    was not due to chance,
    and vaccine affected the rate of infection.
\end{itemize}

What would it mean if the independence model,
which says the vaccine had no influence on the
rate of infection, is true?
It would mean 11 patients were going to
develop an infection \emph{no matter which group
they were randomized into},
and 9 patients would not develop an infection
\emph{no matter which group they were randomized
into}.
That is, if the vaccine did not affect the rate
of infection, the difference in the infection rates
was due to chance alone in how the patients were
randomized.

Now consider the alternative model:
infection rates were influenced by whether a patient
received the vaccine or not.
If this was true, and especially if this influence
was substantial, we would expect to see some difference
in the infection rates of patients in the groups.

We choose between these two competing claims
by assessing if the data conflict so much with
$H_0$ that the independence model cannot be deemed
reasonable.
If this is the case, and the data support $H_A$,
then we will reject the notion of independence
and conclude there was discrimination.


\subsection{Simulating the study}
\label{simulatingTheStudy}

We're going to implement
\termsub{simulations}{simulation},
where we will pretend we know that the malaria
vaccine being tested does \emph{not} work.
Ultimately, we want to understand if the large
difference we observed is common in these
simulations.
If it is common, then maybe the difference
we observed was purely due to chance.
If it is very uncommon, then the possibility
that the vaccine was helpful seems more plausible.

Table \@ref(tab:malaria-vaccine-20-exp-summary)
shows that 11 patients developed infections and 9 did not.
For our simulation, we will suppose the infections
were independent of the vaccine and we were able to
\emph{rewind} back to when the researchers randomized
the patients in the study.
If we happened to randomize the patients differently,
we may get a different result in this hypothetical
world where the vaccine doesn't influence the infection.
Let's complete another \term{randomization} using
a simulation.


In this \term{simulation}, we take 20 notecards to
represent the 20 patients, where we write down ``infection''
on 11 cards and ``no infection'' on 9 cards.
In this hypothetical world, we believe each patient
that got an infection was going to get it regardless
of which group they were in, so let's see what happens
if we randomly assign the patients to the treatment
and control groups again.
We thoroughly shuffle the notecards and deal 14 into
a \resp{vaccine} pile and 6 into a \resp{placebo} pile.
Finally, we tabulate the results, which are shown in
Figure \ref{malaria-vaccine-20-exp-summary_rand_1}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l l cc rr}
  & & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\var{outcome}} \\

What is the difference in infection rates between

\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{$4 / 6 - 7 / 14 = 0.167$
  or about 16.7\% in favor of the vaccine.
  This difference due to chance is much smaller than the
  difference observed in the actual groups.}
-->
<p>As we saw in Section <a href="inference-foundations.html#inf-rand">5.1</a>, we can randomize the responses (<code>infection</code> or <code>no infection</code>) to the treatment conditions under the null hypothesis of independence and compute possible differences in proportions.
The process by which we randomize observations to two groups is summarized and visualized in Figure <a href="inference-foundations.html#fig:fullrand">5.7</a>.</p>
<!--
We computed one possible difference under the
independence model in Guided
Practice \ref{malaria-vaccine-20-exp-summary_rand_1_diff},
which represents one difference due to chance.
While in this first simulation, we physically dealt
out notecards to represent the patients,
it is more efficient to perform this simulation
using a computer.
Repeating the simulation on a computer, we get another
difference due to chance:
\begin{align*}
\frac{2}{\malariaBD{}} - \frac{9}{\malariaAD{}} = -0.310
\end{align*}
And another:
\begin{align*}
\frac{3}{\malariaBD{}} - \frac{8}{\malariaAD{}} = -0.071
\end{align*}
And so on until we repeat the simulation enough times
that we have a good idea of what represents the
\emph{distribution of differences from chance alone}.

We simulated the differences assuming that the independence

fluctuation, where <em>near</em> is pretty generous in this
case since the sample sizes are so small in this study.</p>

<div class="example">

<hr />
It appears that a difference of at least
64.3% due to chance alone would only
happen about 2% of the time according to
Figure <a href="inference-cat.html#fig:malaria-rand-dot-plot">6.3</a>.
Such a low probability indicates a rare event.
</div>
<p>The difference of 64.3% being
a rare event suggests two possible interpretations
of the results of the study:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> Independence model. The vaccine has no effect on infection rate, and we just happened to observe a difference that would only occur on a rare occasion.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span> Alternative model. The vaccine has an effect on infection rate, and the difference we observed was actually due to the vaccine being effective at combating malaria, which explains the large difference of 64.3%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the simulations, we have two options:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>We conclude that the study results do not provide
strong evidence against the independence model.
That is, we do not have sufficiently strong evidence
to conclude the vaccine had an effect in this
clinical setting.</p></li>
<li><p>We conclude the evidence is sufficiently strong
to reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> and assert that the vaccine was useful.
When we conduct formal studies, usually we reject the
notion that we just happened to observe a rare
event.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a>
In this case, we reject the independence model in favor
of the alternative.
That is, we are concluding the data provide strong evidence
that the vaccine provides some protection against malaria
in this clinical setting.</p></li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>Statistical inference, is built
on evaluating whether such differences are due to chance.
In statistical inference, data scientists evaluate which
model is most reasonable given the data.
Errors do occur, just like rare events, and we might choose
the wrong model.
While we do not always choose correctly, statistical
inference gives us tools to control and evaluate how
often these errors occur.</p>

<p>Hypothesis tests are not flawless. Just think of the court system: innocent people are sometimes wrongly convicted and the guilty sometimes walk free.
Similarly, data can point to the wrong conclusion.
However, what distinguishes statistical hypothesis tests from a court system is that our framework allows us to quantify and control how often the data lead us to the incorrect conclusion.</p>
<p>In a hypothesis test, there are two competing hypotheses: the null and the alternative.
We make a statement about which one might be true, but we might choose incorrectly. There are four possible scenarios in a hypothesis test, which are summarized in Table <a href="inference-cat.html#tab:fourHTScenarios">6.2</a>.</p>

<p>A <strong>Type 1 Error</strong> is rejecting the null hypothesis when <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is actually true.
Since we rejected the null hypothesis in the gender discrimination and opportunity cost studies, it is possible that we made a Type 1 Error in one or both of those studies.
A <strong>Type 2 Error</strong> is failing to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative is actually true.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>In a US court, the defendant is either innocent (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) or guilty (<span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span>).
What does a Type 1 Error represent in this context?
What does a Type 2 Error represent?
Table <a href="inference-cat.html#tab:fourHTScenarios">6.2</a> may be useful.</p>
<hr />
If the court makes a Type 1 Error, this means the defendant is innocent (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> true) but wrongly convicted.
A Type 2 Error means the court failed to reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> (i.e., failed to convict the person) when they were in fact guilty (<span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span> true).
</div>

<div class="guidedpractice">

</div>

<div class="example">
<p>How could we reduce the Type 1 Error rate in US courts?
What influence would this have on the Type 2 Error rate?</p>
<hr />
To lower the Type 1 Error rate, we might raise our standard for conviction from “beyond a reasonable doubt” to “beyond a conceivable doubt” so fewer people would be wrongly convicted. However, this would also make it more difficult to convict the people who are actually guilty, so we would make more Type 2 Errors.

<p>The example and guided practice above provide an important lesson: if we reduce how often we make one type of error, we generally make more of the other type.</p>

%Hypothesis testing is built around rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis. That is, we do not reject $H_0$ unless the data provide strong evidence against it. But what precisely does *strong evidence* mean? As a general rule of thumb, for those cases where the null hypothesis is actually true, we do not want to incorrectly reject $H_0$ more than 5% of the time. This corresponds to our default significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$, which we use as a comparison with the p-value. In the next section, we discuss the appropriateness of different significance levels.

%\section[Case study: CPR and blood thinner (randomization)]{Case study: blood thinner and CPR\\(randomization)}
-->
<p></p>
<p>In Section <a href="inference-foundations.html#inf-rand">5.1</a> we explored whether women were discriminated against and whether a simple trick could make students a little thriftier.
In these two case studies, we’ve actually ignored some possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if <em>men</em> are actually discriminated against?</li>
<li>What if the money trick actually makes students <em>spend more</em>?</li>
</ul>
<p>These possibilities weren’t considered in our original hypotheses or analyses.
The disregard of the extra alternatives may have seemed natural since the data pointed in the directions in which we framed the problems. However, there are two dangers if we ignore possibilities that disagree with our data or that conflict with our world view:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Framing an alternative hypothesis simply to match the direction that the data point will generally inflate the Type 1 Error rate. After all the work we’ve done (and will continue to do) to rigorously control the error rates in hypothesis tests, careless construction of the alternative hypotheses can disrupt that hard work.</p></li>
<li><p>If we only use alternative hypotheses that agree with our worldview, then we’re going to be subjecting ourselves to <strong>confirmation bias</strong>, which means we are looking for data that supports our ideas. That’s not very scientific, and we can do better!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The original hypotheses we’ve seen are called <strong>one-sided hypothesis tests</strong> because they only explored one direction of possibilities.
Such hypotheses are appropriate when we are exclusively interested in the single direction, but usually we want to consider all possibilities.
To do so, let’s learn about <strong>two-sided hypothesis tests</strong> in the context of a new study that examines the impact of using blood thinners on patients who have undergone CPR.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a procedure used on individuals suffering a heart attack when other emergency resources are unavailable.
This procedure is helpful in providing some blood circulation to keep a person alive, but CPR chest compressions can also cause internal injuries. Internal bleeding and other injuries that can result from CPR complicate additional treatment efforts.
For instance, blood thinners may be used to help release a clot that is causing the heart attack once a patient arrives in the hospital. However, blood thinners negatively affect internal injuries.</p>
<p>Here we consider an experiment with patients who underwent CPR for a heart attack and were subsequently admitted to a hospital.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a>
Each patient was randomly assigned to either receive a blood thinner (treatment group) or not receive a blood thinner (control group).
The outcome variable of interest was whether the patient survived for at least 24 hours.</p>
<!--

<p>According to the point estimate, for patients who have undergone CPR outside of the hospital, an additional 13% of these patients survive when they are treated with blood thinners.
However, we wonder if this difference could be easily explainable by chance.</p>
<p>As we did in our past two studies this chapter, we will simulate what type of differences we might see from chance alone under the null hypothesis.
By randomly assigning “simulated treatment” and “simulated control” stickers to the patients’ files, we get a new grouping.
If we repeat this simulation 10,000 times, we can build a <strong>null distribution</strong> of the differences shown in Figure <a href="inference-cat.html#fig:CPR-study-right-tail">6.4</a>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The right tail area is 0.131. (Note: it is only a coincidence that we also have <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_t - \hat{p}_c=0.13\)</span>.)
However, contrary to how we calculated the p-value in previous studies, the p-value of this test is not 0.131!</p>
<p>The p-value is defined as the chance we observe a result at least as favorable to the alternative hypothesis as the result (i.e., the difference) we observe.
In this case, any differences less than or equal to -0.13 would also provide equally strong evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis as a difference of +0.13 did.
A difference of -0.13 would correspond to 13% higher survival rate in the control group than the treatment group.
In Figure <a href="inference-cat.html#fig:CPR-study-p-value">6.5</a> we’ve also shaded these differences in the left tail of the distribution.
These two shaded tails provide a visual representation of the p-value for a two-sided test.</p>
<!--
%There is something different in this study than in the past studies: in this study, we are particularly interested in whether blood thinners increase *or* decrease the risk of death in patients who undergo CPR before arriving at the hospital.\footnote{Realistically, we probably are interested in either direction in the past studies as well, and so we should have used the approach we now discuss in this section. However, for simplicity and the sake of not introducing too many concepts at once, we skipped over these details in earlier sections.} For example, there are chance differences of $\hat{p}_t - \hat{p}_c = -0.14$, that would have been stronger evidence against the null hypothesis as our observed difference of +0.13. Likewise, anything less than or equal -0.13 would provide as much evidence against the null hypothesis as +0.13, and for this reason, we must count both tails towards the p-value, as shown in Figure \ref{CPR-study-p-value}.

<p>For a two-sided test, take the single tail (in this case, 0.131) and double it to get the p-value: 0.262.
Since this p-value is larger than 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis.
That is, we do not find statistically significant evidence that the blood thinner has any influence on survival of patients who undergo CPR prior to arriving at the hospital.</p>

<p><strong>Default to a two-sided test.</strong></p>

Use a one-sided hypothesis test only if you truly have interest in only one direction.

<div class="onebox">
<p><strong>Computing a p-value for a two-sided test.</strong></p>
First compute the p-value for one tail of the distribution, then double that value to get the two-sided p-value.
That’s it!
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>Consider the situation of the medical consultant.
Now that you know about one-sided and two-sided tests, which type of test do you think is more appropriate?</p>
<hr />
The setting has been framed in the context of the consultant being helpful (which is what led us to a one-sided test originally), but what if the consultant actually performed <em>worse</em> than the average?
Would we care?
More than ever!
Since it turns out that we care about a finding in either direction, we should run a two-sided test.
The p-value for the two-sided test is double that of the one-sided test, here the simulated p-value would be 0.2444.
</div>
<p>Generally, to find a two-sided p-value we double the single tail area, which remains a reasonable approach even when the sampling distribution is asymmetric.
However, the approach can result in p-values larger than 1 when the point estimate is very near the mean in the null distribution; in such cases, we write that the p-value is 1.
Also, very large p-values computed in this way (e.g., 0.85), may also be slightly inflated.
Typically, we do not worry too much about the precision of very large p-values because they lead to the same analysis conclusion, even if the value is slightly off.</p>

<div id="controlling-the-type-1-error-rate" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Controlling the Type 1 Error rate</h4>
<p>Now that we understand the difference between one-sided and two-sided tests, we must recognize when to use each type of test.
Because of the result of increased error rates, it is never okay to change two-sided tests to one-sided tests after observing the data.
We explore the consequences of ignoring this advice in the next example.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>Using <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span>, we show that freely switching from two-sided tests to one-sided tests will lead us to make twice as many Type 1 Errors as intended.</p>
<hr />
<p>Suppose we are interested in finding any difference from 0.
We’ve created a smooth-looking <strong>null distribution</strong> representing differences due to chance in Figure <a href="inference-cat.html#fig:type1ErrorDoublingExampleFigure">6.6</a>.</p>
<p>Suppose the sample difference was larger than 0.
Then if we can flip to a one-sided test, we would use <span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span>: difference <span class="math inline">\(&gt; 0\)</span>.
Now if we obtain any observation in the upper 5% of the distribution, we would reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> since the p-value would just be a the single tail.
Thus, if the null hypothesis is true, we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis about 5% of the time when the sample mean is above the null value, as shown in Figure <a href="inference-cat.html#fig:type1ErrorDoublingExampleFigure">6.6</a>.</p>
<p>Suppose the sample difference was smaller than 0.
Then if we change to a one-sided test, we would use <span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span>: difference <span class="math inline">\(&lt; 0\)</span>.
If the observed difference falls in the lower 5% of the figure, we would reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>.
That is, if the null hypothesis is true, then we would observe this situation about 5% of the time.</p>
By examining these two scenarios, we can determine that we will make a Type 1 Error <span class="math inline">\(5\%+5\%=10\%\)</span> of the time if we are allowed to swap to the “best” one-sided test for the data.
This is twice the error rate we prescribed with our significance level: <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span> (!).

<p>The key will be to use two different bags to simulate from the original data.</p>
<p>Use the CPR data. After we find the CI (use percentile and SE methods), write the interval values down below in the math section that describes the generic confidence interval method.</p>
<p>In Section <a href="inference-cat.html#two-prop-errors">6.2.1</a>, we worked with the randomization distribution to understand the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2\)</span> when the null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0: p_1 - p_2 = 0\)</span> is true.

<div id="observed-data-2" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Observed data</h4>
<p>Reconsider the CPR data from Section <a href="inference-cat.html#two-prop-errors">6.2.1</a> which is provided in Table <a href="inference-cat.html#tab:resultsForCPRStudyInSmallSampleSection">6.3</a>. The experiment consisted of two treatments on patients who underwent CPR for a heart attack and were subsequently admitted to a hospital. Each patient was randomly assigned to either receive a blood thinner (treatment group) or not receive a blood thinner (control group).
The outcome variable of interest was whether the patient survived for at least 24 hours.</p>
<p>Again, we use the difference in sample proportions as the observed statistic of interest. Here, the value of the statistic is: <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_t - \hat{p}_c = 0.35 - 0.22 = 0.13\)</span>.</p>

<h4>Variability of the statistic</h4>
<p>The bootstrap method applied to two samples is an extension of the method described in Section <a href="inference-foundations.html#boot-ci">5.2</a>. Now, we have two samples, so each sample estimates the population from which they came. In the CPR setting, the <code>treatment</code> sample estimates the population of all individuals who have gotten (or will get) the treatment; the <code>control</code> sample estimate the population of all individuals who do not get the treatment and are controls. Figure <a href="inference-cat.html#fig:boot2samp1">6.7</a> extends Figure <a href="inference-foundations.html#fig:boot1">5.8</a> to show the bootstrapping process from two samples simultaneously.</p>

<p>The variability of the statistic (the difference in sample proportions) can be calculated by taking one treatment bootstrap sample and one control bootstrap sample and calculating the difference of the bootstrap survival proportions. One sample from each of the estimated populations has been taken with the sample proportions calculated for the treatment bootstrap sample and the control bootstrap sample.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="inference-cat.html#fig:bootCPR1000">6.10</a> provides an estimate for the variability of the difference in survival proportions from sample to sample, The values in the histogram can be used in two different ways to create a confidence interval for the parameter of interest: <span class="math inline">\(p_1 - p_2\)</span>.</p>
<div id="percentile-bootstrap-interval" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Percentile bootstrap interval</h5>
<p>As in Section <a href="inference-foundations.html#boot-ci">5.2</a>, the bootstrap confidence interval can be calculated directly from the bootstrapped differences in Figure <a href="inference-cat.html#fig:bootCPR1000">6.10</a>. The interval created from the percentiles of the distribution is called the <strong>percentile interval</strong>.
Note that here we calculate the 90% confidence interval by finding the <span class="math inline">\(5^{th}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(95^{th}\)</span> percentile values from the bootstrapped differences.
The bootstrap 5 percentile proportion is -0.155 and the 95 percentile is 0.167.
The result is: we are 90% confident that, in the population, the true difference in probability of survival is between -0.155 and 0.167.
The interval shows that we do not have much definitive evidence of the affect of blood thinners, one way or another.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we can use the variability in the bootstrapped differences to calculate a standard error of the difference.
The resulting interval is called the <strong>SE interval</strong>.
Section <a href="inference-cat.html#math-2prop">6.2.3</a> details the mathematical model for the standard error of the difference in sample proportions, but the bootstrap distribution typically does an excellent job of estimating the variability.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[SE(\hat{p}_t - \hat{p}_c) \approx SD(\hat{p}_{bs,t} - \hat{p}_{bs,c}) = 0.0975\]</span></p>
<p>The calculation above was performed in R using the <code>sd()</code> function, but any statistical software will calculate the standard deviation of the differences, here, the exact quantity we hope to approximate.</p>
<p>Because we don’t know the true distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_t - \hat{p}_c\)</span>, we will use a rough approximation to find a confidence interval for <span class="math inline">\(p_t - p_c\)</span>.

<p>We are 95% confident that the true value of <span class="math inline">\(p_t - p_c\)</span> is between -0.065 and 0.325. Again, the wide confidence interval that overlaps zero indicates that the study provides very little evidence about the effectiveness of blood thinners.</p>

<h4>Hypothesis test for <span class="math inline">\(H_0: p_1 - p_2 = 0\)</span></h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>A mammogram is an X-ray procedure used to check for
breast cancer.
Whether mammograms should be used is part of a
controversial discussion, and it’s the topic of our
next example where we learn about 2-proportion
hypothesis tests when <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(p_1 - p_2 = 0\)</span>
(or equivalently, <span class="math inline">\(p_1 = p_2\)</span>).</p>
<p>A 30-year study was conducted with nearly 90,000 female participants. During a 5-year screening period, each woman was randomized to one of two groups: in the first group, women received regular mammograms to screen for breast cancer, and in the second group, women received regular non-mammogram breast cancer exams. No intervention was made during the following 25 years of the study, and we’ll consider death resulting from breast cancer over the full 30-year period. Results from the study are summarized in Figure <a href="inference-cat.html#tab:mammogramStudySummaryTable">6.5</a>.</p>
<p>If mammograms are much more effective than non-mammogram breast cancer exams, then we would expect to see additional deaths from breast cancer in the control group. On the other hand, if mammograms are not as effective as regular breast cancer exams, we would expect to see an increase in breast cancer deaths in the mammogram group.</p>

Set up hypotheses to test whether there was a difference
in breast cancer deaths in the mammogram and control groups.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a>
</div>
<p>Using the previous example,
we will check the conditions for using a normal distribution to
analyze the results of the study.
The details are very similar to that of confidence intervals.
However, when the null hypothesis is that <span class="math inline">\(p_1 - p_2 = 0\)</span>,
we use a special proportion called the
<strong>pooled proportion</strong> to check the success-failure condition:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\hat{p}_{\textit{pool}}
    &amp;= \frac
        {\text{# of patients who died from breast cancer in the entire study}}
        {\text{# of patients in the entire study}} \\
	&amp;= \frac{500 + 505}{500 + \text{44,425} + 505 + \text{44,405}} \\
	&amp;= 0.0112
\end{align*}\]</span>
This proportion is an estimate of the breast cancer death rate
across the entire study, and it’s our best estimate of the
proportions <span class="math inline">\(p_{mgm}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_{ctrl}\)</span>
<em>if the null hypothesis is true that <span class="math inline">\(p_{mgm} = p_{ctrl}\)</span></em>.
We will also use this pooled proportion when computing
the standard error.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>Is it reasonable to model the difference
in proportions using a normal distribution in this
study?</p>
<hr />
Because the patients are randomized, they can be treated
as independent, both within and between groups.
We also must check the success-failure condition for each group.
Under the null hypothesis, the proportions <span class="math inline">\(p_{mgm}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(p_{ctrl}\)</span> are equal, so we check the success-failure
condition with our best estimate of these values under <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>,
the pooled proportion from the two samples,
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{\textit{pool}} = 0.0112\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  \hat{p}_{\textit{pool}} \times n_{mgm}
      &amp;= 0.0112 \times \text{44,925} = 503
    &amp; (1 - \hat{p}_{\textit{pool}}) \times n_{mgm}
      &amp;= 0.9888 \times \text{44,925} = \text{44,422} \\
  \hat{p}_{\textit{pool}} \times n_{ctrl}
      &amp;= 0.0112 \times \text{44,910} = 503
    &amp; (1 - \hat{p}_{\textit{pool}}) \times n_{ctrl}
      &amp;= 0.9888 \times \text{44,910} = \text{44,407}
  \end{align*}\]</span>
The success-failure condition is satisfied since
all values are at least 10.
With both conditions satisfied, we can safely model
the difference in proportions using a normal
distribution.
</div>

<div class="onebox">
<p><strong>Use the pooled proportion when <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(p_1 - p_2 = 0\)</span>.</strong></p>
When the null hypothesis is that the proportions are equal,
use the pooled proportion (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{\textit{pooled}}\)</span>)
to verify the
success-failure condition and estimate the standard error:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray*}
  \hat{p}_{\textit{pooled}}
    = \frac{\text{number of ``successes&quot;}}
      {\text{number of cases}}
    = \frac{\hat{p}_1 n_1 + \hat{p}_2 n_2}{n_1 + n_2}
  \end{eqnarray*}\]</span>
Here <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_1 n_1\)</span> represents the number of successes in
sample 1 since
<span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray*}
  \hat{p}_1
    = \frac{\text{number of successes in sample 1}}{n_1}
  \end{eqnarray*}\]</span>
Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_2 n_2\)</span> represents the number
of successes in sample 2.
</div>
<p>In the previous example,
the pooled proportion was used to check the success-failure
condition<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a>. In the next example, we see an additional place where the pooled
proportion comes into play: the standard error calculation.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>Compute the point estimate of the difference
in breast cancer death rates in the two groups,
and use the pooled proportion
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{\textit{pool}} = 0.0112\)</span> to calculate
the standard error.</p>
<hr />
The point estimate of the difference in breast cancer death
rates is
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  \hat{p}_{mgm} - \hat{p}_{ctrl}
    &amp;= \frac{500}{500 + 44,425} - \frac{505}{505 + 44,405} \\
    &amp;= 0.01113 - 0.01125 \\
    &amp;= -0.00012
  \end{align*}\]</span>
The breast cancer death rate in the mammogram group
was 0.012% less than in the control group.
Next, the standard error is calculated
, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{\textit{pool}}\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
SE = \sqrt{
      \frac{\hat{p}_{\textit{pool}}(1-\hat{p}_{\textit{pool}})}
          {n_{mgm}}
      + \frac{\hat{p}_{\textit{pool}}(1-\hat{p}_{\textit{pool}})}
          {n_{ctrl}}
    }
	= 0.00070
\end{align*}\]</span>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>Using the point estimate <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{mgm} - \hat{p}_{ctrl} = -0.00012\)</span> and standard error <span class="math inline">\(SE = 0.00070\)</span>, calculate a p-value for the hypothesis test and write a conclusion.</p>
<hr />
<p>Just like in past tests, we first compute a test statistic and draw a picture:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
Z = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE}
	= \frac{-0.00012 - 0}{0.00070}
	= -0.17
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
The lower tail area is 0.4325, which we double to get the p-value: 0.8650. Because this p-value is larger than 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis. That is, the difference in breast cancer death rates is reasonably explained by chance, and we do not observe benefits or harm from mammograms relative to a regular breast exam.
</div>
<p><img src="06-inference-cat_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-70-1.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Can we conclude that mammograms have no benefits or harm?
Here are a few considerations to keep in mind when reviewing
the mammogram study as well as any other medical study:</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not accept the null hypothesis, which means
we don’t have sufficient evidence to conclude that
mammograms reduce or increase breast cancer deaths.</li>
<li>If mammograms are helpful or harmful, the data
suggest the effect isn’t very large.</li>
<li>Are mammograms more or less expensive than
a non-mammogram breast exam?
If one option is much more expensive than the
other and doesn’t offer clear benefits,
then we should lean towards the less expensive
option.</li>
<li>The study’s authors also found that mammograms
led to over-diagnosis of breast cancer,
which means some breast cancers were found
(or thought to be found) but that these cancers
would not cause symptoms during patients’ lifetimes.
That is, something else would kill the patient
before breast cancer symptoms appeared.
This means some patients may have been treated
for breast cancer unnecessarily, and this
treatment is another cost to consider.
It is also important to recognize that
over-diagnosis can cause unnecessary physical
or emotional harm to patients.</li>
</ul>
<p>These considerations highlight the complexity around medical care and treatment recommendations. Experts and medical boards who study medical treatments use considerations like those above to provide their best recommendation based on the current evidence.</p>

\BeginKnitrBlock{onebox}<div class="onebox">**Hypothesis testing when ${H_0}$ is $p_1 - p_2 = 0$.**
  
  Once you've determined a hypothesis test for the difference
  of two proportions is the correct procedure, there are four
  steps to completing the test:

* **Prepare.**
      Identify the parameter of interest,
      list out hypotheses,
      identify the significance level,
      and compute summary statistics for each group.
* **Check.**
      Verify the conditions to ensure
      $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$ is nearly normal under $H_0$.
      When the null hypothesis is that the difference is 0,
      use a pooled proportion to check the success-failure
      condition for each group.
* **Calculate.**
      If the conditions hold, compute the standard
      error, again using the pooled proportion,
      compute the Z-score, and identify the p-value.

\subsection{More on 2-proportion hypothesis tests (special topic)}

When we conduct a 2-proportion hypothesis test,
usually $H_0$ is $p_1 - p_2 = 0$. However, there are rare
situations where we want to check for some difference in
$p_1$ and $p_2$ that is some value other than 0.
For example, maybe we care about checking a null hypothesis
where $p_1 - p_2 = 0.1$. %\footnote{We can
%  also encounter a similar situation with a difference of
%  two means, though no such example is given in
%  Chapter \ref{inferenceForNumericalData} since the methods
%  remain exactly the same in the context of sample means.
%  On the other hand, the success-failure condition and the
%  calculation of the standard error vary slightly in different
%  proportion contexts.}
In contexts like these, we generally use $\hat{p}_1$ and
$\hat{p}_2$ to check the success-failure condition and
construct the standard error.

%\Add{In Guided Practice \ref{qualityCtrlEngHypothesisEval}, the null difference is 0.03. However, in the vast majority of applications for differences in means or proportions, the null difference is 0. While the details for a difference of means does not change if the null difference is zero or non-zero, that is not the case for a difference in proportions. As we'll see in Section \ref{}, a hypothesis test for a difference in proportions where the null value is 0 requires additional care.}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{The quality control engineer from
    Guided Practice \ref{carWheelBladeManufacturer}
    collects a sample of blades, examining 1000 blades
    from each company, and she finds that 899 blades pass
    inspection from the current supplier and 958 pass
    inspection from the prospective supplier.
    Using these data, evaluate the hypotheses from
    Guided Practice \ref{carWheelBladeManufacturer}
    with a significance level of 5%.}
  \label{qualityCtrlEngHypothesisEval}%
  First, we check the conditions.
  The sample is not necessarily random, so to proceed
  we must assume the blades are all independent;
  for this sample we will suppose this assumption
  is reasonable, but the engineer would be more knowledgeable
  as to whether this assumption is appropriate.
  The success-failure condition also holds for each sample.
  Thus, the difference in sample proportions,
  $0.958 - 0.899 = 0.059$, can be said to come from a nearly
  normal distribution.

  The standard error is computed using the two sample
  proportions since we do not use a pooled proportion
  for this context:
  \begin{align*}
  SE
    = \sqrt{\frac{0.958(1-0.958)}{1000} +
        \frac{0.899(1-0.899)}{1000}}
    = 0.0114
  \end{align*}
  In this hypothesis test, because the null is that
  $p_1 - p_2 = 0.03$, the sample proportions were used
  for the standard error calculation rather than a pooled
  proportion.

  Next, we compute the test statistic and use it to find the
  p-value, which is depicted in
  Figure \ref{bladesTwoSampleHTPValueQC}.
  \begin{align*}
  Z = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE}
    = \frac{0.059 - 0.03}{0.0114} = 2.54
  \end{align*}
  Using a standard normal distribution for this test statistic,
  we identify the right tail area as 0.006,
  and we double it to get the p-value: 0.012.
  We reject the null hypothesis because 0.012 is less than 0.05.
  Since we observed a larger-than-3% increase in blades
  that pass inspection, we have statistically significant
  evidence that the higher-quality blades pass inspection
  \emph{more than} 3% as often as the currently used blades,
  exceeding the company's claims.

<p>We all buy used products –
cars, computers, textbooks, and so on –
and we sometimes assume the sellers of those products
will be forthright about any underlying problems with
what they’re selling.
This is not something we should take for granted.
Researchers recruited 219 participants in a study where they
would sell a used iPod<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a>
that was known to have frozen twice in the past.
The participants were incentivized to get as much money
as they could for the iPod since they would receive a 5%
cut of the sale on top of $10 for participating.
The researchers wanted to understand what types of questions
would elicit the seller to disclose the freezing issue.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the participants who were the sellers
in the study,
the buyers were collaborating with the researchers
to evaluate the influence of different questions
on the likelihood of getting the sellers to disclose
the past issues with the iPod.
The scripted buyers started with
“Okay, I guess I’m supposed to go first.
So you’ve had the iPod for 2 years …”
and ended with one of three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>General: What can you tell me about it?<br />
</li>
<li>Positive Assumption: It doesn’t have any problems, does it?<br />
</li>
<li>Negative Assumption: What problems does it have?</li>
</ul>
<p>The question is the treatment given to the sellers,
and the response is whether the question prompted them
to disclose the freezing issue with the iPod.
The results are shown in Table <a href="inference-cat.html#tab:ipod-ask-data-summary">6.6</a>,
and the data suggest that asking the,
<em>What problems does it have?</em>,
was the most effective at getting the seller to disclose
the past freezing issues.
However, you should also be asking yourself:
could we see these results due to chance alone,
or is this in fact evidence that some questions
are more effective for getting at the truth?</p>

  A two-way table describes counts for *combinations*

<p>The hypothesis test for the iPod experiment is really about
assessing whether there is statistically significant evidence
that there was a difference in the success rates that each question had on getting the participant
to disclose the problem with the iPod.
In other words, the goal is to check whether the buyer’s
question was independent of whether the seller disclosed
a problem.</p>
<div id="expected-counts-in-two-way-tables" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Expected counts in two-way tables</h4>
<p>While we would not expect the number of disclosures to be exactly the same across the three groups, the rate of disclosure seems substantially different across the three groups.
In order to investigate whether the differences in rates is due to natural variability or due to a treatment effect (i.e., the question causing the differences), we need to compute estimated counts for each cell in a two-way table.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>From the experiment,
we can compute the proportion of all sellers who disclosed
the freezing problem as <span class="math inline">\(61/219 = 0.2785\)</span>.
If there really is no difference among the questions
and 27.85% of sellers were going to disclose the freezing
problem no matter the question that was put to them,
how many of the 73 people in the <code>General</code>
group would we have expected to disclose the freezing
problem?</p>
<hr />
We would predict that <span class="math inline">\(0.2785 \times 73 = 20.33\)</span>
sellers would disclose the problem.
Obviously we observed fewer than this, though it is not
yet clear if that is due to chance variation or whether
that is because the questions vary in how effective they
are at getting to the truth.
</div>

<div class="guidedpractice">
If the questions were actually equally effective,
meaning about 27.85% of respondents would disclose the
freezing issue regardless of what question they were asked,
about how many sellers would we expect to  the
freezing problem from the Positive Assumption

</div>
<p>We can compute the expected number of sellers who we would
expect to disclose or hide the freezing issue for all groups,
if the questions had no impact on what they disclosed,
using the same strategies employed in the previous Example and Guided Practice to computed expected counts.
These expected counts were used to construct Table <a href="inference-cat.html#tab:ipod-ask-data-summary-expected">6.7</a>,

<p>The examples and exercises above provided some help
in computing expected counts.
In general, expected counts for a two-way table may
be computed using the row totals, column totals,
and the table total.
For instance, if there was no difference between the groups,
then about 27.85% of each column should be in the first row:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
0.2785\times (\text{column 1 total}) &amp;= 20.33 \\
0.2785\times (\text{column 2 total}) &amp;= 20.33 \\
0.2785\times (\text{column 3 total}) &amp;= 20.33
\end{align*}\]</span>
Looking back to how 0.2785 was computed –
as the fraction of sellers who disclosed the freezing issue
(<span class="math inline">\(158/219\)</span>) –
these three expected counts could have been computed as
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\left(\frac{\text{row 1 total}}{\text{table total}}\right)
    \text{(column 1 total)} &amp;= 20.33 \\
\left(\frac{\text{row 1 total}}{\text{table total}}\right)
    \text{(column 2 total)} &amp;= 20.33 \\
\left(\frac{\text{row 1 total}}{\text{table total}}\right)
    \text{(column 3 total)} &amp;= 20.33
\end{align*}\]</span>
This leads us to a general formula for computing expected
counts in a two-way table when we would like to test whether
there is strong evidence of an association between the column
variable and row variable.</p>

<h5>Variability of the statistic</h5>
<p>Is 40.13 a big number? That is, does it indicate that the observed and expected values are really different? Or is 40.13 a value of the statistic that we’d expect to see just due to natural variability? Previously, we applied the randomization test to the setting where the research question investigated a difference in proportions. The same idea of shuffling the data under the null hypothesis can be used in the setting of the two-way table.</p>
<p>Assuming that the individuals would disclose or hide the problems <strong>regardless</strong> of the question they are given (i.e., that the null hypothesis is true), we can randomize the data by reassigning the 61 disclosed problems and 158 hidden problems to the three groups at random. Table <a href="inference-cat.html#tab:ipod-ask-data-summary-rand">6.8</a> shows a possible randomization of the observed data under the condition that the null hypothesis is true (in contrast to the original observed data in Table <a href="inference-cat.html#tab:ipod-ask-data-summary">6.6</a>).</p>

<p>As before, the randomized data is used to find a single value for the test statistic (here a chi-squared statistic).
The chi-square statistic for the randomized two-way table is found
by comparing the observed and expected counts for each cell in the <em>randomized</em> table.
For each cell, compute:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
&amp;\text{General formula} &amp;&amp;
    \frac{(\text{observed count } - \text{expected count})^2}
        {\text{expected count}} \\

<h5>Observed statistic vs null statistics</h5>
<p>As before, one randomization will not be sufficient for understanding if the observed data are particularly different from the expected chi-square statistics when <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is true. To investigate whether 40.13 is large enough to indicate the the observed and expected counts are significantly different, we need to understand what values of the chi-squared statistic would happen just due to change. Figure <a href="inference-cat.html#fig:ipodRandDotPlot">6.11</a> plots 1000 chi-squared statistics generated under the null hypothesis. We can see that the observed value is so far from the null statistics that the simulated p-value is zero. That is, the probability of seeing the observed statistic when the null hypothesis is true is virtually zero. In this case we can conclude that the decision of whether or not to disclose the iPod’s problem is changed by the question asked. (We use the causal language of “changed” because the study was an experiment.) Note that with a chi-squared test, we only know that the two variables (here: <code>question</code> and <code>disclosure</code>) are related (i.e., not independent). We are not able to claim which type of question causes which type of disclosure.</p>

<li id="fn66"><p><span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>: There is no association between the consultant’s contributions and the clients’ complication rate. In statistical language, <span class="math inline">\(p=0.10\)</span>.
<span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span>: Patients who work with the consultant tend to have a complication rate lower than 10%, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(p&lt;0.10\)</span>.<a href="inference-cat.html#fnref66" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn67"><p>There isn’t sufficiently strong evidence to support an association between the consultant’s work and fewer surgery complications.<a href="inference-cat.html#fnref67" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn68"><p>No. It might be that the consultant’s work is associated with a reduction but that there isn’t enough data to convincingly show this connection.<a href="inference-cat.html#fnref68" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn69"><p>Because the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is unknown but expected to be around 2/3, we will use 2/3 in place of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in the formula for the standard error.<br />
<span class="math inline">\(SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \approx  \sqrt{\frac{2/3 (1 - 2/3)}  {300}} = 0.027\)</span>.<a href="inference-cat.html#fnref69" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn70"><p>This is equivalent to asking how often the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> score will be larger than -2.58 but less than 2.58. (For a picture, see Figure <a href="inference-cat.html#fig:choosingZForCI">6.2</a>.) To determine this probability, look up -2.58 and 2.58 in the normal probability table (0.0049 and 0.9951). Thus, there is a <span class="math inline">\(0.9951-0.0049 \approx 0.99\)</span> probability that the unobserved random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> will be within 2.58 standard deviations of the mean.<a href="inference-cat.html#fnref70" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn71"><p>Since the necessary conditions for applying the normal model have already been checked for us, we can go straight to the construction of the confidence interval: <span class="math inline">\(\text{point estimate}\ \pm\ 2.58 \times SE \rightarrow (0.018, 0.162)\)</span>. We are 99% confident that implanting a stent in the brain of a patient who is at risk of stroke increases the risk of stroke within 30 days by a rate of 0.018 to 0.162 (assuming the patients are representative of the population).<a href="inference-cat.html#fnref71" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn72"><p>We must find <span class="math inline">\(z^{\star}\)</span> such that 90% of the distribution falls between -<span class="math inline">\(z^{\star}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z^{\star}\)</span> in the standard normal model, <span class="math inline">\(N(\mu=0, \sigma=1)\)</span>. We can look up -<span class="math inline">\(z^{\star}\)</span> in the normal probability table by looking for a lower tail of 5% (the other 5% is in the upper tail), thus <span class="math inline">\(z^{\star}=1.65\)</span>. The 90% confidence interval can then be computed as <span class="math inline">\(\text{point estimate}\ \pm\ 1.65\times SE \to (4.4\%, 13.6\%)\)</span>. (Note: the conditions for normality had earlier been confirmed for us.) That is, we are 90% confident that implanting a stent in a stroke patient’s brain increased the risk of stroke within 30 days by 4.4% to 13.6%.<a href="inference-cat.html#fnref72" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn73"><p><span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>: there is not support for the regulation; <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(p \leq 0.50\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span>: the majority of borrowers support the regulation; <span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; 0.50\)</span>.<a href="inference-cat.html#fnref73" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn74"><p>Independence holds since the poll
is based on a random sample.
The success-failure condition also holds,
which is checked
using the null value (<span class="math inline">\(p_0 = 0.5\)</span>) from <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>:
<span class="math inline">\(np_0 = 826 \times 0.5 = 413\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(n(1 - p_0) = 826 \times 0.5 = 413\)</span>. Recall that here, the best guess for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(p_0\)</span> which comes from the null hypothesis (because we assume the null hypothesis is true when performing the testing procedure steps). <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>: there is not support for the regulation; <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(p \leq 0.50\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span>: the majority of borrowers support the regulation; <span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; 0.50\)</span>.<a href="inference-cat.html#fnref74" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn75"><p>The
study is an experiment, as patients were randomly
assigned an experiment group.
Since this is an experiment, the results can be used
to evaluate a causal relationship between the malaria
vaccine and whether patients showed signs
of an infection.<a href="inference-cat.html#fnref75" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn76"><p>This reasoning does not generally extend
to anecdotal observations.
Each of us observes incredibly rare events every day,
events we could not possibly hope to predict.
However, in the non-rigorous setting of anecdotal
evidence, almost anything may appear to be a rare event,
so the idea of looking for rare events in day-to-day
activities is treacherous.
For example, we might look at the lottery:
there was only a 1 in 292 million chance that the
Powerball numbers for the largest jackpot in history
(January 13th, 2016) would be (04, 08, 19, 27, 34)
with a Powerball of (10),
but nonetheless those numbers came up!
However, no matter what numbers had turned up,
they would have had the same incredibly rare odds.
That is, <em>any set of numbers we could have
observed would ultimately be incredibly rare</em>.
This type of situation is typical of our daily lives:
each possible event in itself seems incredibly rare,
but if we consider every alternative, those outcomes
are also incredibly rare.
We should be cautious not to misinterpret such
anecdotal evidence.<a href="inference-cat.html#fnref76" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn77"><p>Making a Type 1 Error in this context would mean that reminding students that money not spent now can be spent later does not affect their buying habits, despite the strong evidence (the data suggesting otherwise) found in the experiment. Notice that this does <em>not</em> necessarily mean something was wrong with the data or that we made a computational mistake. Sometimes data simply point us to the wrong conclusion, which is why scientific studies are often repeated to check initial findings.<a href="inference-cat.html#fnref77" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn78"><p>To lower the Type 2 Error rate, we want to convict more guilty people. We could lower the standards for conviction from “beyond a reasonable doubt” to “beyond a little doubt”. Lowering the bar for guilt will also result in more wrongful convictions, raising the Type 1 Error rate.<a href="inference-cat.html#fnref78" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>

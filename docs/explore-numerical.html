<div class="chapterintro">
<p>This chapter focuses on exploring <strong>quantitative</strong> data using summary statistics and visualizations.
The summaries and graphs presented in this chapter are created using statistical software; however, since this might be your first exposure to the concepts, we take our time in this chapter to detail how to create them.
Mastery of the content presented in this chapter will be crucial for understanding the methods and techniques introduced in the rest of the book.</p>
</div>
<p>Consider the <code>loan_amount</code> variable from the <code>loan50</code> data set, which represents the loan size for all 50 loans in the data set.
This variable is quantitative (or numerical) since we can sensibly discuss the numerical difference of the size of two loans.
On the other hand, area codes and zip codes are not quantitative, but rather they are categorical variables.</p>
<p>Throughout this chapter, we will apply these methods using the <code>loan50</code>, <code>county</code>, and <code>email50</code> data sets, which were introduced in Section <a href="data-hello.html#data-basics">1.2</a>.
If you’d like to review the variables from either data set, see Tables <a href="data-hello.html#tab:loan50Variables">1.4</a> and <a href="data-hello.html#tab:countyVariables">1.6</a>.</p>
<div class="data">
<p>The <code>loan50</code> and <code>email50</code> data sets can be found in the <a href="http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro">openintro</a> package.
The <code>county</code> data can be found in the <a href="https://openintrostat.github.io/usdata/">usdata</a> package.</p>
</div>
<div id="scatterplots" class="section level2" number="5.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Scatterplots for paired data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#scatterplots"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p></p>
<p>A <strong>scatterplot</strong> provides a case-by-case view of data for two quantitative variables.
In Figure <a href="data-hello.html#fig:county-multi-unit-homeownership">1.4</a>, a scatterplot was used to examine the homeownership rate against the fraction of housing units that were part of multi-unit properties (e.g. apartments) in the <code>county</code> data set.
Another scatterplot is shown in Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:loan50-amount-income">5.1</a>, comparing the total income of a borrower <code>total_income</code> and the amount they borrowed <code>loan_amount</code> for the <code>loan50</code> data set.
In any scatterplot, each point represents a single case.
Since there are 50 cases in <code>loan50</code>, there are 50 points in Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:loan50-amount-income">5.1</a>.</p>
<p>When examining scatterplots, we describe four features:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Form</strong> - If you were to trace the trend of the points,
would the trend be <em>linear</em> or <em>nonlinear</em>?</li>
<li>
<strong>Direction</strong> - As values on the <em>x</em>-axis increase, do the <em>y</em>-values
tend to increase (<em>positive direction</em>) or do they decrease (<em>negative direction</em>)?</li>
<li>
<strong>Strength</strong> - How closely do the points follow a trend?</li>
<li>
<strong>Unusual observations</strong> or <strong>outliers</strong>- Are there any unusual observations
that do not seem to match the overall pattern of the scatterplot?</li>
</ol>

</p>
</div>
<p>Looking at Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:loan50-amount-income">5.1</a>, we see that there are many
borrowers with income below $100,000 on the left side of the graph, while there
are a handful of borrowers with income above $250,000. The loan amounts vary from
below $10,000 to around $40,000. The data seem to have a <em>linear</em> form, though
the relationship between the two variables is quite <em>weak</em>. The direction is
<em>positive</em>—as total income increases, the loan amount also tends to increase—and there may be a few unusual observations in the higher income range,
though since the relationship is weak, it is hard to tell.</p>

<div class="workedexample">
<p>Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:median-hh-income-poverty">5.2</a> shows a plot of median household income against the poverty rate for 3,142 counties.
What can be said about the relationship between these variables?</p>
<hr>
<p>The relationship is evidently <strong>nonlinear</strong>, as highlighted by the dashed line. This is different from previous scatterplots we have seen, which show relationships that do not show much, if any, curvature in the trend.
The relationship is moderate to strong, the direction is negative,
and there does not appear to be any unusual observations.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Dot plots and the mean<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dotplots"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Sometimes we are interested in the distribution of a single variable.
In these cases, a dot plot provides the most basic of displays.
A <strong>dot plot</strong> is a one-variable scatterplot; an example using the interest rate of 50 loans is shown in Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:loan-int-rate-dotplot">5.3</a>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>distribution</strong> of a variable is a description of the possible values
it takes and how frequently each value occurs. The <strong>mean</strong>, often called the <strong>average</strong>, is a common way to measure the center of a distribution of data.
To compute the mean interest rate of the 50 loans above, we add up all the interest rates and divide by the number of observations.</p>
<p>The sample mean is often labeled <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>.
The letter <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is being used as a generic placeholder for the variable and the bar over the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> communicates we’re looking at the average of that variable. In our example <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> would represent interest rate, and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> = 11.57%.
It is useful to think of the mean as the balancing point of the distribution<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;For
more practice with this concept of the mean as a balancing point, see this &lt;a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/summarizing-quantitative-data-ap/mean-median-more/a/mean-as-the-balancing-point"&gt;Khan Academy article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>39</sup></a>, and it’s shown as a triangle in Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:loan-int-rate-dotplot">5.3</a>.</p>
<div class="onebox">
<p><strong>Mean.</strong></p>
<p>The sample mean can be calculated as the sum of the observed values divided by the number of observations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="guidedpractice">
<p>Examine the equation for the mean. What does <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> correspond to? And <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> Can you infer a general meaning to what <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> might represent?<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; corresponds to the interest rate for the first loan in the sample, &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt; to the second loan’s interest rate, and &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(x_i\)&lt;/span&gt; corresponds to the interest rate for the &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(i^{th}\)&lt;/span&gt; loan in the data set. For example, if &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(i = 4\)&lt;/span&gt;, then we’re examining &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(x_4\)&lt;/span&gt;, which refers to the fourth observation in the data set.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<div class="guidedpractice">

</div>
<p>The <code>loan50</code> data set represents a sample from a larger population of loans made through Lending Club.
We could compute a mean for this population in the same way as the sample mean.
However, the population mean has a special label: <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>.
The symbol <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the Greek letter <em>mu</em> and represents the average of all observations in the population.
Sometimes a subscript, such as <span class="math inline">\(_x\)</span>, is used to represent which variable the population mean refers to, e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\mu_x\)</span>.
Often times it is too expensive or time consuming to measure the population mean precisely, so we often estimate <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> using the sample mean, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>.</p>
<div class="pronunciation">
<p>The Greek letter <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is pronounced <em>mu</em>, listen to the pronunciation <a href="https://youtu.be/PStgY5AcEIw?t=47">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="workedexample">
<p>The average interest rate across all loans in the population can be estimated using the sample data. Based on the sample of 50 loans, what would be a reasonable estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_x\)</span>, the mean interest rate for all loans in the full data set?</p>
<hr>
<p>The sample mean, 11.57%, provides a rough estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_x\)</span>. While it is not perfect, this statistic our single best guess <strong>point estimate</strong> of the average interest rate of all the loans in the population under study, the parameter. In Chapter <a href="foundations-randomization.html#foundations-randomization">9</a> and beyond, we will develop tools to characterize the accuracy of point estimates, like the sample mean. As you might have guessed, point estimates based on larger samples tend to be more accurate than those based on smaller samples.</p>
</div>
<p>The mean is useful for making comparisons across different samples that may have different sample sizes because it allows us to rescale or standardize a metric into something more easily interpretable and comparable.</p>
<p>Suppose we would like to understand if a new drug is more effective at treating asthma attacks than the standard drug.
A trial of 1500 adults is set up, where 500 receive the new drug, and 1000 receive a standard drug in the control group:</p>
<div class="inline-table"><table class="table table-sm">
<thead><tr>
<th style="text-align:left;">
</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">
New drug
</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">
Standard drug
</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Number of patients
</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">
500
</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">
1000
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Total asthma attacks
</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">
200
</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">
300
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
<p>Comparing the raw counts of 200 to 300 asthma attacks would make it appear that the new drug is better, but this is an artifact of the imbalanced group sizes.
Instead, we should look at the average number of asthma attacks per patient in each group:</p>
<ul>
<li>New drug: <span class="math inline">\(200 / 500 = 0.4\)</span> asthma attacks per patient</li>
<li>Standard drug: <span class="math inline">\(300 / 1000 = 0.3\)</span> asthma attacks per patient</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard drug has a lower average number of asthma attacks per patient than the average in the treatment group.</p>

<p>Emilio opened a food truck last year where he sells burritos, and his business has stabilized over the last 4 months.
Over that 4 month period, he has made $11,000 while working 625 hours.

<p>Suppose we want to compute the average income per person in the US. To do so, we might first think to take the mean of the per capita incomes across the 3,142 counties in the data set. What would be a better approach?</p>
<hr>
<p>The <code>county</code> data set is special in that each county actually represents many individual people.
If we were to simply average across the <code>income</code> variable, we would be treating counties with 5,000 and 5,000,000 residents equally in the calculations.
Instead, we should compute the total income for each county, add up all the counties’ totals, and then divide by the number of people in all the counties.
If we completed these steps with the data, we would find that the per capita income for the US is $30,861.
Had we computed the <em>simple</em> mean of per capita income across counties, the result would have been just $26,093!</p>
<p>This example used what is called a <strong>weighted mean</strong>.

<p>Dot plots show the exact value for each observation. This is useful for small data sets, but they can become hard to read with larger samples. Rather than showing the value of each observation, we prefer to think of the value as belonging to a <em>bin</em>. For example, in the <code>loan50</code> data set, we created a table of counts for the number of loans with interest rates between 5.0% and 7.5%, then the number of loans with rates between 7.5% and 10.0%, and so on. Observations that fall on the boundary of a bin (e.g., 10.00%) are allocated to the lower bin. This tabulation is shown in Table <a href="explore-numerical.html#tab:binnedIntRateAmountTable">5.1</a>. These binned counts are plotted as bars in Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:loan50IntRateHist">5.4</a> into what is called a <strong>histogram</strong>, which resembles a more heavily binned version of the stacked dot plot shown in Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:loan-int-rate-dotplot">5.3</a>.</p>

<p>Histograms provide a view of the <strong>data density</strong>. Higher bars represent where the data are relatively more common, or
“dense.” For instance, there are many more loans with rates between 5% and 10% than loans with rates between 20% and 25% in the data set. The bars make it easy to see how the density of the data changes relative to the interest rate.</p>
<p>Histograms are especially convenient for understanding the shape of the data distribution. Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:loan50IntRateHist">5.4</a> suggests that most loans have rates under 15%, while only a handful of loans have rates above 20%. When data trail off to the right in this way and has a longer right <strong>tail</strong>, the shape is said to be <strong>right skewed</strong><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Other ways to describe data that are right skewed: skewed to the right, skewed to the high end, or skewed to the positive end.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>Data sets with the reverse characteristic—a long, thinner tail to the left—are said to be <strong>left skewed</strong>. We also say that such a distribution has a long left tail. Data sets that show roughly equal trailing off in both directions are called <strong>symmetric</strong>.</p>
<div class="onebox">
<p>When data trail off in one direction, the distribution has a <strong>long tail</strong>.
If a distribution has a long left tail, it is <strong>left skewed</strong> or <strong>negatively skewed</strong>.
If a distribution has a long right tail, it is <strong>right skewed</strong> or <strong>positively skewed</strong>.</p>

<p>Besides the mean (since it was labeled), what can you see in the dot plot in Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:loan-int-rate-dotplot">5.3</a> that you cannot see in the histogram in Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:loan50IntRateHist">5.4</a>?<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;The interest rates for individual loans.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>In addition to looking at whether a distribution is skewed or symmetric, histograms can be used to identify modes. A <strong>mode</strong> is represented by a prominent peak in the distribution. There is only one prominent peak in the histogram of <code>interest_rate</code>.</p>
<p>A definition of <em>mode</em> sometimes taught in math classes is the value with the most occurrences in the data set. However, for many real-world data sets, it is common to have <em>no</em> observations with the same value in a data set, making this definition impractical in data analysis.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:singleBiMultiModalPlots">5.5</a> shows histograms that have one, two, or three prominent peaks. Such distributions are called <strong>unimodal</strong>, <strong>bimodal</strong>, and <strong>multimodal</strong>, respectively. Any distribution with more than two prominent peaks is called multimodal. Notice that there was one prominent peak in the unimodal distribution with a second less prominent peak that was not counted since it only differs from its neighboring bins by a few observations.</p>

<p>Looking for modes isn’t about finding a clear and correct answer about the number of modes in a distribution, which is why <em>prominent</em> is not rigorously defined in this book. The most important part of this examination is to better understand your data.</p>
<p>Another type of plot that is helpful for exploring the shape of a distribution is a smoothed histogram, called a <strong>density plot</strong>. A density plot will scale the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis so that the total area under the density curve is equal to one. This allows us to get a sense of what <em>proportion</em> of the data lie in a certain interval, rather than the <em>frequency</em> of data in the interval. We can change the scale of a histogram to plot proportions rather than frequencies, then overlay a density curve on this rescaled histogram, as seen in Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:loan50IntRateDens">5.6</a>.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Variance and standard deviation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#variance-sd"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The mean was introduced as a method to describe the center of a data set, and <strong>variability</strong> in the data is also important. Here, we introduce two measures of variability: the variance and the standard deviation. Both of these are very useful in data analysis, even though their formulas are a bit tedious to calculate by hand. The standard deviation is the easier of the two to comprehend, and it roughly describes how far away the typical observation is from the mean.</p>
<p>We call the distance of an observation from its mean its <strong>deviation</strong>. Below are the deviations for the <span class="math inline">\(1^{st}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2^{nd}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(3^{rd}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(50^{th}\)</span> observations in the <code>interest_rate</code> variable:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ x_1 - \bar{x} = 10.9 - 11.57 = -0.67 \]</span> <span class="math display">\[ x_2 - \bar{x} = 9.92 - 11.57 = -1.65 \]</span> <span class="math display">\[ x_3 - \bar{x} = 26.3 - 11.57 = 14.73 \]</span> <span class="math display">\[ \vdots \]</span> <span class="math display">\[ x_{50} - \bar{x} = 6.08 - 11.57 = -5.49 \]</span></p>
<p>If we square these deviations and then take an average, the result is equal to the sample <strong>variance</strong>, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
s^2 &amp;= \frac{(-0.67)^2 + (-1.65)^2 + (14.73)^2 + \cdots + (-5.49)^2}{50 - 1} \\
&amp;= \frac{0.45 + 2.72 + \cdots + 30.14}{49} \\
&amp;= 25.52
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>We divide by <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span>, rather than dividing by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, when computing a sample’s variance; there’s some mathematical nuance here, but the end result is that doing this makes this statistic slightly more reliable and useful.</p>
<p>Notice that squaring the deviations does two things. First, it makes large values relatively much larger. Second, it gets rid of any negative signs.</p>
<p>The <strong>standard deviation</strong> is defined as the square root of the variance:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ s = \sqrt{25.52} = 5.05 \]</span></p>
<p>While often omitted, a subscript of <span class="math inline">\(_x\)</span> may be added to the variance and standard deviation, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(s_x^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_x\)</span>, if it is useful as a reminder that these are the variance and standard deviation of the observations represented by <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span>.</p>
<div class="onebox">
<p><strong>Variance and standard deviation.</strong></p>
<p>The sample variance is the (near) average squared distance from the mean:
<span class="math display">\[
  s^2 = \frac{((x_1 - \bar{x})^2 + (x_2 - \bar{x})^2 + \cdots + (x_n - \bar{x})^2)}{n-1}
\]</span>
The sample standard deviation is the square root of the variance: <span class="math inline">\(s = \sqrt{s^2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The standard deviation is useful when considering how far the data are distributed from the mean.
<em>The standard deviation represents the typical deviation of observations from the mean.</em>
If the distribution is bell-shaped, about 70% of the data will be within one standard deviation of the mean and about 95% will be within two standard deviations.
However, these percentages do not necessarily hold for other shaped distributions!</p>
</div>
<p>Like the mean, the population values for variance and standard deviation have special symbols: <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> for the variance and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> for the standard deviation.</p>

Also note any especially unusual cases.</p>
<hr>
<p>The distribution of interest rates is unimodal and skewed to the high end. Many of the rates fall near the mean at 11.57%, and most fall within one standard deviation (5.05%) of the mean.
There are a few exceptionally large interest rates in the sample that are above 20%.</p>

the median, the median is the <span class="math inline">\(50^{th}\)</span> percentile.</p>
<div class="onebox">
<p><strong>Percentiles.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong><span class="math inline">\(p^{th}\)</span> percentile</strong> is a value such that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>% of the data fall <em>below</em>
that value. For example, 7.96
is the <span class="math inline">\(25^{th}\)</span> percentile of the interest rates shown in Table <a href="explore-numerical.html#tab:loan50-int-rate-sorted">5.2</a> since 25% of the data fall below

<p>The second step in building a box plot is drawing a rectangle to represent the

The length of the the box is called the <strong>interquartile range</strong>, or <strong>IQR</strong> for short.
It, like the standard deviation, is a measure of variability in data.
The more variable the data, the larger the standard deviation and IQR tend to be.
The two boundaries of the box are called the <strong>first quartile</strong> (the <span class="math inline">\(25^{th}\)</span> percentile) and the <strong>third quartile</strong> (the <span class="math inline">\(75^{th}\)</span> percentile) , and these are often labeled <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>, respectively<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;The first and third quartiles are called quartiles because, together with the median (the second quartile), these three values break the data into four groups of equal size–the lowest 25%, next lowest 25%, next lowest 25%, and highest 25%.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p>Extending out from the box, the <strong>whiskers</strong> attempt to capture the data outside of the box.
The whiskers of a box plot reach to the minimum and the maximum values in the data, unless there are points that are considered unusually high or unusually low, which are identified as potential <strong>outliers</strong> by the box plot.
These are labeled with a dot on the box plot.
The purpose of labeling these points—instead of extending the whiskers to the minimum and maximum observed values—is to help identify any observations that appear to be unusually distant from the rest of the data.
There are a variety of formulas for determining whether a particular data point is considered an outlier, and different statistical software use different formulas.
A commonly used formula is that any value that is beyond <span class="math inline">\(1.5\times IQR\)</span>[While the choice of exactly 1.5 is arbitrary, it is the most commonly used value for box plots.] away from the box is considered an outlier.
In a sense, the box is like the body of the box plot and the whiskers are like its arms trying to reach the rest of the data, up to the outliers.</p>
<p>In Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:loan-int-rate-boxplot-dotplot">5.9</a>,
the upper whisker does not extend to the last two points, 24.85% and 26.3%, which are above
<span class="math inline">\(Q_3 + 1.5\times IQR\)</span>, and so it extends only to the last point below this limit.
The lower whisker stops at the minimum value in the data set, 5.31%, since there are no outliers on the lower end of the distribution.</p>
<div class="protip">
<p>The whiskers extend to actual data points—not the limits for outliers. That is,
the values <span class="math inline">\(Q_1 - 1.5\times IQR\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q_3 + 1.5\times IQR\)</span> should not be shown

</h2>
<p>As a review, when describing a scatterplot—the association between
two quantitative variables, we look for the four features:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Form</li>
<li>Direction</li>
<li>Strength</li>
<li>Outliers</li>
</ol>
<p>When asked to describe or compare univariate (single variable) quantitative distributions, we look for four features:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Center</li>
<li>Variability</li>
<li>Shape</li>
<li>Outliers</li>
</ol>
<p>We can compare quantitative distributions by using side-by-side box plots,
or stacked histograms or dot plots. Recall that the <code>loan50</code> data set represents a sample from a larger loan data set called <code>loans</code>.
This larger data set contains information on 10,000 loans made through Lending Club. Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:homeownership-interest-boxplots">5.10</a> examines the relationship between <code>homeownership</code>, which for the <code>loans</code> data can take a value of <code>rent</code>, <code>mortgage</code> (owns but has a mortgage), or <code>own</code>, and <code>interest_rate</code>. Note that <code>homeownership</code>
is a categorical variable and <code>interest_rate</code> is a quantitative variable.</p>

Figure 5.10: Side-by-side box plots of loan interest rates by homeownership category and corresponding histograms.
</p>
</div>
<p>We see immediately that some features are easier to discern in box plots, while others in histograms. Shape is shown more clearly in histograms, while center (as measured by the median) is easy to compare across groups in the side-by-side box plots.</p>
<div class="workedexample">
<p>Using Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:homeownership-interest-boxplots">5.10</a> write a few sentences comparing the distributions of loan amount
across the different homeownership categories.</p>
<hr>
<p>The median loan amount is higher for those with a mortgage (around $16,000) than for those who own or rent (around $12,000-$13,000). However, variability in loan amounts is similar across homeownership categories, with an IQR of around $15,000 and loans ranging from a few hundred dollars to $40,000. We see from the histograms that the distribution of loan amounts is skewed right for all three homeownership categories, which means the mean loan amount will be higher than the median loan amount. There are no apparent outliers in the mortgage category, but both the rent and own categories have outliers at $40,000.</p>
<p>Besides center, variability, shape, and outliers, another interesting feature in these distributions is the result of rounding. Loan amounts in the data set are often rounded to the nearest 100, so we see spikes on these values in the histogram—something that is not evident in the box plots.</p>

<p>The median and IQR are called <strong>robust statistics</strong> because extreme observations have little effect on their values—moving the most extreme value generally has little influence on these statistics.
On the other hand, the mean and standard deviation are more heavily influenced by changes in extreme observations, which can be important in some situations. Additionally, the mean tends to get pulled in the direction of a distribution’s skewness, while the skewness has little affect on the median.</p>

<p>Consider the histogram of county populations shown in the left of Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:county-pop-transform">5.12</a>, which shows extreme skew. What is not so useful about this plot?</p>
<hr>
<p>Nearly all of the data fall into the left-most bin, and the extreme skew obscures many of the potentially interesting details in the data.</p>
</div>
<p>There are some standard transformations that may be useful for strongly right skewed data where much of the data is positive but clustered near zero.
For instance, a plot of the logarithm (base 10) of county populations results in the new histogram in Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:county-pop-transform">5.12</a>.
This data is symmetric, and any potential outliers appear much less extreme than in the original data set.
By reigning in the outliers and extreme skew, transformations like this often make it easier to build statistical models against the data.</p>
<p>Transformations can also be applied to one or both variables in a scatterplot.
A scatterplot of the population change from 2010 to 2017 against the population in 2010 is shown in Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:county-pop-change-transform">5.13</a>.
In this first scatterplot, it’s hard to decipher any interesting patterns because the population variable is so strongly skewed.
However, if we apply a log<span class="math inline">\(_{10}\)</span> transformation to the population variable, as shown in
Figure <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:county-pop-change-transform">5.13</a>, a positive association between the variables is revealed.
In fact, we may be interested in fitting a trend line to the data when we explore methods around fitting regression lines in Chapter <a href="explore-regression.html#explore-regression">6</a>.</p>

<p>Transformations other than the logarithm can be useful, too.
For instance, the square root (<span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\text{original observation}}\)</span>) and inverse (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\text{original observation}}\)</span>) are commonly used by data scientists.
Common goals in transforming data are to see the data structure differently, reduce skew, assist in modeling, or straighten a nonlinear relationship in a scatterplot.</p>

<p>The <code>county</code> data set offers many numerical variables that we could plot using dot plots, scatterplots, or box plots, but these miss the true nature of the data.
Rather, when we encounter geographic data, we should create an <strong>intensity map</strong>, where colors are used to show higher and lower values of a variable.
Figures <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:county-intensity-map-poverty-unemp">5.14</a> and <a href="explore-numerical.html#fig:county-intensity-map-homeownership-median-income">5.15</a> show intensity maps for poverty rate in percent (<code>poverty</code>), unemployment rate (<code>unemployment_rate</code>), homeownership rate in percent (<code>homeownership</code>), and median household income (<code>median_hh_income</code>).
The color key indicates which colors correspond to which values.
The intensity maps are not generally very helpful for getting precise values in any given county, but they are very helpful for seeing geographic trends and generating interesting research questions or hypotheses.</p>
<div class="workedexample">
<p>What interesting features are evident in the poverty and unemployment rate intensity maps?</p>
<hr>
<p>Poverty rates are evidently higher in a few locations.
Notably, the deep south shows higher poverty rates, as does much of Arizona and New Mexico.
High poverty rates are evident in the Mississippi flood plains a little north of New Orleans and also in a large section of Kentucky.
The unemployment rate follows similar trends, and we can see correspondence between the two
variables.
In fact, it makes sense for higher rates of unemployment to be closely related to poverty rates.
One observation that stands out when comparing the two maps: the poverty rate is much higher than the unemployment rate, meaning while many people may be working, they are not making enough to break out of poverty.</p>

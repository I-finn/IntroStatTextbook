# Appendix: Case studies {#case-studies}

Each week, you will work through a case study and post responses to discussion questions about these case studies in our D2L Discussion forums. We recommend you read through the case study and post responses earlier in the week so that our classroom community can engage in a meaningful discussion about each case study.

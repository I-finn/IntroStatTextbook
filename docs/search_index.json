We use statistical software for generating the summaries and graphs presented in this chapter and book. However, since this might be your first exposure to these concepts, we take our time in this chapter to detail how to create them. Mastery of the content presented in this chapter will be crucial for understanding the methods and techniques introduced in rest of the book. 2.1 Exploring quantitative data In this section we will explore techniques for summarizing quantitative variables. For example, consider the loan_amount variable from the loan50 data set, which represents the loan size for all 50 loans in the data set. This variable is quantitative since we can sensibly discuss the numerical difference of the size of two loans. On the other hand, area codes and zip codes are not quantitative, but rather they are categorical variables. Throughout this section and the next, we will apply these methods using the loan50, county, and email50 data sets, which were introduced in Section 1.2. If you’d like to review the variables from either data set, see Tables ?? and ??. The loan50 and email50 data sets can be found in the openintro package. The county data can be found in the usdata package. 2.1.1 Scatterplots for paired data A scatterplot provides a case-by-case view of data for two quantitative variables. In Figure ??, a scatterplot was used to examine the homeownership rate against the fraction of housing units that were part of multi-unit properties (e.g. apartments) in the county data set. Another scatterplot is shown in Figure 2.1, comparing the total income of a borrower total_income and the amount they borrowed loan_amount for the loan50 data set. In any scatterplot, each point represents a single case. Since there are 50 cases in loan50, there are 50 points in Figure 2.1. When examining scatterplots, we describe four features: Form - If you were to trace the trend of the points, would the trend be linear or nonlinear? Direction - As values on the x-axis increase, do the y-values tend to increase (positive) or do they decrease (negative)? Strength - How closely to the points follow a trend? Unusual observations or outliers- Are there any unusual observations that do not seem to match the overall pattern of the scatterplot? Figure 2.1: A scatterplot of loan_amount versus total_income for the loan50 data set. Looking at Figure 2.1, we see that there are many borrowers with income below $100,000 on the left side of the graph, while there are a handful of borrowers with income above $250,000. The loan amounts vary from below $10,000 to around $40,000. The data seem to have a linear form, though the relationship between the two variables is quite weak. The direction is positive – as total income increases, the loan amount also tends to increase – and there may be a few unusual observations in the higher income range, though since the relationship is weak, it is hard to tell. Figure 2.2: A scatterplot of the median household income against the poverty rate for the county dataset. Data are from 2017. A statistical model has also been fit to the data and is shown as a dashed line. Figure 2.2 shows a plot of median household income against the poverty rate for r nrow(county) counties. What can be said about the relationship between these variables? The relationship is evidently nonlinear, as highlighted by the dashed line. This is different from previous scatterplots we have seen, which show relationships that do not show much, if any, curvature in the trend. The relationship is moderate to strong, the direction is negative, and there does not appear to be any unusual observations. What do scatterplots reveal about the data, and how are they useful?1 Describe two variables that would have a horseshoe-shaped association in a scatterplot (\\(\\cap\\) or \\(\\frown\\))2 2.1.2 Dot plots and the mean Sometimes we are interested in the distribution of a single variable. In these cases, a dot plot provides the most basic of displays. A dot plot is a one-variable scatterplot; an example using the interest rate of 50 loans is shown in Figure 2.3. Figure 2.3: A dot plot of interest_rate for the loan50 dataset. The rates have been rounded to the nearest percent in this plot, and the distribution’s mean is shown as a red triangle. The mean, often called the average is a common way to measure the center of a distribution of data. To compute the mean interest rate, we add up all the interest rates and divide by the number of observations. The sample mean is often labeled \\(\\bar{x}\\). The letter \\(x\\) is being used as a generic placeholder for the variable of interest and the bar over the \\(x\\) communicates we’re looking at the average interest rate, which for these 50 loans is 11.57%. It’s useful to think of the mean as the balancing point of the distribution, and it’s shown as a triangle in Figure 2.3. Mean. The sample mean can be calculated as the sum of the observed values divided by the number of observations: \\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n}{n} \\] Examine the equation for the mean. What does \\(x_1\\) correspond to? And \\(x_2\\) Can you infer a general meaning to what \\(n_i\\) might represent?3 What was \\(n\\) in this sample of loans?4 The loan50 data set represents a sample from a larger population of loans made through Lending Club. We could compute a mean for this population in the same way as the sample mean. However, the population mean has a special label: \\(\\mu\\). The symbol \\(\\mu\\) is the Greek letter mu and represents the average of all observations in the population. Sometimes a subscript, such as \\(_x\\), is used to represent which variable the population mean refers to, e.g. \\(\\mu_x\\). Often times it is too expensive to measure the population mean precisely, so we often estimate \\(\\mu\\) using the sample mean, \\(\\bar{x}\\). The Greek letter \\(\\mu\\) is pronounced mu, listen to the pronunciation here. The average interest rate across all loans in the population can be estimated using the sample data. Based on the sample of 50 loans, what would be a reasonable estimate of \\(\\mu_x\\), the mean interest rate for all loans in the full data set? The sample mean, r {round(loan50_mean_intrest_rate, 2)}, provides a rough estimate of \\(\\mu_x\\). While it is not perfect, this is our single best guess point estimate of the average interest rate of all the loans in the population under study. In Chapter 5 and beyond, we will develop tools to characterize the accuracy of point estimates, like the sample mean. As you might have guessed, point estimates based on larger samples tend to be more accurate than those based on smaller samples. The mean is useful because it allows us to rescale or standardize a metric into something more easily interpretable and comparable. Suppose we would like to understand if a new drug is more effective at treating asthma attacks than the standard drug. A trial of 1500 adults is set up, where 500 receive the new drug, and 1000 receive a standard drug in the control group: New drug Standard drug Number of patients 500 1000 Total asthma attacks 200 300 Comparing the raw counts of 200 to 300 asthma attacks would make it appear that the new drug is better, but this is an artifact of the imbalanced group sizes. Instead, we should look at the average number of asthma attacks per patient in each group: New drug: \\(200 / 500 = 0.4\\) asthma attacks per patient Standard drug: \\(300 / 1000 = 0.3\\) asthma attacks per patient The standard drug has a lower average number of asthma attacks per patient than the average in the treatment group. Provide another examples where the mean is useful for making comparisons. Emilio opened a food truck last year where he sells burritos, and his business has stabilized over the last 3 months. Over that 3 month period, he has made $11,000 while working 625 hours. Emilio’s average hourly earnings provides a useful statistic for evaluating whether his venture is, at least from a financial perspective, worth it: \\[ \\frac{\\$11000}{625\\text{ hours}} = \\$17.60\\text{ per hour} \\] By knowing his average hourly wage, Emilio now has put his earnings into a standard unit that is easier to compare with many other jobs that he might consider. Suppose we want to compute the average income per person in the US. To do so, we might first think to take the mean of the per capita incomes across the 3,142 counties in the data set. What would be a better approach? The county data set is special in that each county actually represents many individual people. If we were to simply average across the income variable, we would be treating counties with 5,000 and 5,000,000 residents equally in the calculations. Instead, we should compute the total income for each county, add up all the counties’ totals, and then divide by the number of people in all the counties. If we completed these steps with the data, we would find that the per capita income for the US is $30,861. Had we computed the simple mean of per capita income across counties, the result would have been just $26,093! This example used what is called a weighted mean. For more information on this topic, check out the following online supplement regarding weighted means. 2.1.3 Histograms and shape Dot plots show the exact value for each observation. This is useful for small data sets, but they can become hard to read with larger samples. Rather than showing the value of each observation, we prefer to think of the value as belonging to a bin. For example, in the loan50 data set, we created a table of counts for the number of loans with interest rates between 5.0% and 7.5%, then the number of loans with rates between 7.5% and 10.0%, and so on. Observations that fall on the boundary of a bin (e.g. 10.00%) are allocated to the lower bin. This tabulation is shown in Table 2.1. These binned counts are plotted as bars in Figure 2.4 into what is called a histogram, which resembles a more heavily binned version of the stacked dot plot shown in Figure 2.3. Table 2.1: Counts for the binned interest_rate data. Interest rate 5% - 7.5% 7.5% - 10% 10% - 12.5% 12.5% - 15% 15% - 17.5% 17.5% - 20% 20% - 22.5% 22.5% - 25% 25% - 27.5% Count 11 15 8 4 5 4 1 1 1 Figure 2.4: A histogram of interest_rate. This distribution is strongly skewed to the right. Histograms provide a view of the data density. Higher bars represent where the data are relatively more common. For instance, there are many more loans with rates between 5% and 10% than loans with rates between 20% and 25% in the data set. The bars make it easy to see how the density of the data changes relative to the interest rate. Histograms are especially convenient for understanding the shape of the data distribution. Figure 2.4 suggests that most loans have rates under 15%, while only a handful of loans have rates above 20%. When data trail off to the right in this way and has a longer right tail, the shape is said to be right skewed5 Data sets with the reverse characteristic – a long, thinner tail to the left – are said to be left skewed. We also say that such a distribution has a long left tail. Data sets that show roughly equal trailing off in both directions are called symmetric. When data trail off in one direction, the distribution has a long tail. If a distribution has a long left tail, it is left skewed or negatively skewed. If a distribution has a long right tail, it is right skewed or positively skewed. Besides the mean (since it was labeled), what can you see in the dot plot in Figure 2.3 that you cannot see in the histogram in Figure 2.4?6 In addition to looking at whether a distribution is skewed or symmetric, histograms can be used to identify modes. A mode is represented by a prominent peak in the distribution. There is only one prominent peak in the histogram of interest_rate. A definition of mode sometimes taught in math classes is the value with the most occurrences in the data set. However, for many real-world data sets, it is common to have no observations with the same value in a data set, making this definition impractical in data analysis. Figure 2.5 shows histograms that have one, two, or three prominent peaks. Such distributions are called unimodal, bimodal, and multimodal, respectively. Any distribution with more than 2~prominent peaks is called multimodal. Notice that there was one prominent peak in the unimodal distribution with a second less prominent peak that was not counted since it only differs from its neighboring bins by a few observations. Figure 2.5: Counting only prominent peaks, the distributions are (left to right) unimodal, bimodal, and multimodal. Note that the left plot is unimodal because we are counting prominent peaks, not just any peak. Figure 2.4 reveals only one prominent mode in the interest rate. Is the distribution unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal?7 Height measurements of young students and adult teachers at a K-3 elementary school were taken. How many modes would you expect in this height data set?8. Looking for modes isn’t about finding a clear and correct answer about the number of modes in a distribution, which is why prominent is not rigorously defined in this book. The most important part of this examination is to better understand your data. 2.1.4 Boxplots and the median A boxplot (or box-and-whisker plot) summarizes a data set using five statistics while also plotting unusual observations. The five statistics—minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum—together are called the five number summary. Figure 2.6 provides a vertical dot plot alongside a box plot of the variable from the data set. Figure 2.6: A vertical dot plot next to a labeled box plot for the number of characters in 50 emails. The median (6.89), splits the data into the bottom 50% and the top 50%, marked in the dot plot by horizontal dashes and open circles, respectively. The first step in building a box plot is drawing a dark line denoting the median, which splits the data in half. Figure 2.6 shows 50% of the data falling below the median (dashes) and other 50% falling above the median (open circles). There are 50 character counts in the data set (an even number) so the data are perfectly split into two groups of 25. We take the median in this case to be the average of the two observations closest to the 50th percentile: \\((6.768 + 7.012)/2 = 6.890\\). When there are an odd number of observations, there will be exactly one observation that splits the data into two halves, and in this case that observation is the median (no average needed). Median. If the data are ordered from smallest to largest, the sample median is the observation right in the middle. If there are an even number of observations, there will be two values in the middle, and the median is taken as their average. If we denote the sample size by \\(n\\), then if \\(n\\) is odd, the median is the \\([(n+1)/2]^{th}\\) smallest value in the data set, and if \\(n\\) is even, the median is the average of the \\((n/2)^{th}\\) and \\((n/2+1)^{th}\\) smallest values in the data set. The second step in building a box plot is drawing a rectangle to represent the area of the middle 50% of the data. The total length of the box, shown vertically in Figure 2.6, is called the interquartile range (IQR, for short)(interquartile range, IQR). It is a measure of variability in data. The more variable the data, the larger the IQR. The two boundaries of the box are called the first quartile (the 25th percentile, i.e., 25% of the data fall below this value) and the third quartile (the 75th percentile), and these are often labeled \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_3\\), respectively. (In case you’re wondering, the median is the 2nd quartile! These three quartiles break the data into four groups of equal size.) Interquartile range (IQR). The IQR is the length of the box in a box plot—the range of the middle 50% of the data. It is computed as \\[IQR = Q_3 - Q_1,\\] where \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_3\\) are the 25th and 75th percentiles. What percent of the data fall between \\(Q_1\\) and the median? What percent is between the median and \\(Q_3\\)?9 Extending out from the box, the whiskers attempt to capture the data outside of the box; however, their reach is never allowed to be more than \\(1.5\\times IQR\\).10 They capture everything within this reach. In Figure 2.6, the upper whisker does not extend to the last three points, which are beyond \\(Q_3 + 1.5\\times IQR\\), and so it extends only to the last point below this limit. The lower whisker stops at the lowest value, 33, since there is no additional data to reach; the lower whisker’s limit is not shown in the figure because the plot does not extend down to \\(Q_1 - 1.5\\times IQR\\). In a sense, the box is like the body of the box plot and the whiskers are like its arms trying to reach the rest of the data. The whiskers extend to actual data points—not the limits for outliers. That is, the values \\(Q_1 - 1.5\\times IQR\\) and \\(Q_3 + 1.5\\times IQR\\) should not be shown on the plot. Any observation that lies beyond the whiskers is labeled with a dot. The purpose of labeling these points—instead of just extending the whiskers to the minimum and maximum observed values—is to help identify any observations that appear to be unusually distant from the rest of the data. Unusually distant observations are called outliers. In this case, it would be reasonable to classify the emails with character counts of 41.623, 42.793, and 64.401 as outliers since they are numerically distant from most of the data. Outliers are extreme. An outlier is an observation that is extreme, relative to the rest of the data. Examination of data for possible outliers serves many useful purposes, including: Identifying strong skewness in the distribution Identifying data collection or entry errors. For instance, we re-examined the email purported to have 64.401 characters to ensure this value was accurate. Providing insight into interesting properties of the data. The observation 64.401, an outlier, was found to be an accurate observation. What would such an observation suggest about the nature of character counts in emails?11 Using Figure 2.6, estimate the following values for num_char in the email50 data set: \\(Q_1\\) \\(Q_3\\) \\(IQR\\).12 2.1.5 Robust statistics 2.1.6 Comparing distributions center, shape (symmetric, skewed, normal), spread, outliers side-by-side boxplots, stacked dotplots/histograms 2.1.7 Mapping data (special topic) 2.2 Exploring categorical data Like numerical data, categorical data can also be organized and analyzed. This section introduces tables and other basic tools for categorical data that are used throughout this book. The email data set contains information on 3,921 emails. In this section, we will examine whether the presence of numbers, small or large, in an email provides any useful value in classifying email as spam or not spam. 2.2.1 Contingency tables and conditional proportions One-way and Two-way/contingency tables Define frequencies/counts and relative frequencies/proportions association vs no association in conditional proportions Bayes theorem with tables and trees - conditional vs unconditional probabilities Table 2.2 summarizes two variables: Type (spam or not spam) and Number. Number is a categorical variable that describes whether an email contains no numbers, only small numbers (values under 1 million), or at least one big number (a value of 1 million or more). A table that summarizes data for two categorical variables in this way is called a contingency table or two-way table. Each value in the table represents the number of times, or frequency a particular combination of variable outcomes occurred. For example, the value 149 corresponds to the number of emails in the data set that are spam and had no number listed in the email. Row and column totals are also included. The row totals provide the total counts across each row (e.g., \\(149 + 168 + 50 = 367\\)), and column totals are total counts down each column. A table for a single variable is called a frequency table. Table 2.3 is a frequency table for the Number variable. If we replaced the counts with percentages or proportions, the table would be called a relative frequency table. Table 2.2: Contingency table of Type and Number variables. none small big Total spam 149 168 50 367 not spam 400 2659 495 3554 Total 549 2827 545 3921 Table 2.3: Frequency table of Number variable. none small big 549 2827 545 2.2.2 Bar plots and mosaic plots one cat bar plot two cat bar plot two cat mosaic plot association vs no association in bar plots 2.2.3 Why not pie charts? Answers may vary. Scatterplots are helpful in quickly spotting associations relating variables, whether those associations come in the form of simple trends or whether those relationships are more complex.↩︎ Consider the case where your vertical axis represents something “good” and your horizontal axis represents something that is only good in moderation.

For example, if \\(i = 4\\), then we’re examining \\(x_4\\), which refers to the fourth observation in the data set.↩︎ The sample size was \\(n = 50\\).↩︎ Other ways to describe data that are right skewed: skewed to the right, skewed to the high end, or skewed to the positive end.↩︎ The interest rates for individual loans.↩︎ Unimodal Remember that uni stands for 1 (think unicycles).

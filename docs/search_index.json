These observations—collected from the likes of field notes, surveys, and experiments—form the backbone of a statistical investigation and are called data. Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data, and in this first chapter, we focus on both the properties of data and on the collection of data. Though we were calculating probabilities in the 16th century, and the first US Census was directed by Thomas Jefferson in 17901, the discipline of statistics as we know it came about in the 1800s. Up until the 21st century, the statistical investigation process looked something like this (adapted from Tintle et al. (2016)): Ask a research question. Design a study and collect data. Summarize and visualize the data. Use statistical analysis methods to draw inferences from the data. Communicate the results and answer the research question. Revisit and look forward. With the rise of data science, however, we may not start with a research question, and instead start with a data set2. In this case, the statistical investigation process looks more like the data exploration cycle found in Figure 1.1 taken from Wickham and Grolemund (2017). Figure 1.1: Wickham and Grolemund’s data exploration cycle (2017). In either case, the ideas, concepts, and methods presented in this book will provide you with the tools to work through the statistical investigation process, whether starting with a research question or starting with data. 1.1 Case study: using stents to prevent strokes In this section, we introduce a classic challenge in statistics: evaluating the efficacy of a medical treatment. Terms in this section, and indeed much of this chapter, will all be revisited later in the text. The plan for now is simply to get a sense of the role statistics can play in practice. Here, we will consider an experiment that studies effectiveness of stents in treating patients at risk of stroke (Chimowitz et al. 2011). Stents are small mesh tubes that are placed inside narrow or weak arteries to assist in patient recovery after cardiac events and reduce the risk of an additional heart attack or death. Many doctors have hoped that there would be similar benefits for patients at risk of stroke. We start by writing the principal question the researchers hope to answer: Does the use of stents reduce the risk of stroke? The researchers who asked this question conducted an experiment with 451 at-risk patients. Each volunteer patient was randomly assigned to one of two groups: Treatment group. Patients in the treatment group received a stent and medical management. The medical management included medications, management of risk factors, and help in lifestyle modification. Control group. Patients in the control group received the same medical management as the treatment group, but they did not receive stents. Researchers randomly assigned 224 patients to the treatment group and 227 to the control group. In this study, the control group provides a reference point against which we can measure the medical impact of stents in the treatment group. Researchers studied the effect of stents at two time points: 30 days after enrollment and 365 days after enrollment. The data collected on 5 of these patients are summarized in Table 1.1. Patient outcomes are recorded as stroke or no event, representing whether or not the patient had a stroke during that time period. The stent30 and stent365 data sets from this study can be found in the openintro package. Table 1.1: Results for five patients from the stent study. group 30 days 365 days patient treatment no event no event 1 treatment stroke stroke 2 treatment no event no event 3 treatment no event no event 4 control no event no event 5 Considering data from each of the 451 patients individually would be a long, cumbersome path towards answering the original research question. Instead, performing a statistical data analysis allows us to consider all of the data at once. Table 1.2 summarizes the raw data in a more helpful way. In this table, we can quickly see what happened over the entire study. For instance, to identify the number of patients in the treatment group who had a stroke within 30 days after the treatment, we look in the leftmost column (30 days), at the intersection of treatment and stroke: 33. To identify the number of control patients who did not have a stroke after 365 days after receiving treatment, we look at the rightmost column (365 days), at the intersection of control and no event: 199. Table 1.2: Descriptive statistics for the stent study. 30 days 365 days stroke no event stroke no event treatment 33 191 45 179 control 13 214 28 199 Total 46 405 73 378 The data summarized in this table can also be visualized with a barplot, seen in Figure 1.2: Figure 1.2: Segmented barplot of outcomes in stent study by group and time. Of the 224 patients in the treatment group, 45 had a stroke by the end of the first year. Using these two numbers, compute the proportion of patients in the treatment group who had a stroke by the end of their first year. (Please note: answers to all Guided Practice exercises are provided using footnotes.)3 We can compute summary statistics from the table to give us a better idea of how the impact of the stent treatment differed between the two groups. A summary statistic is a single number summarizing a large amount of data. For instance, the primary results of the study after 1 year could be described by two summary statistics: the proportion of people who had a stroke in the treatment and control groups. Proportion who had a stroke in the treatment (stent) group: \\(45/224 = 0.20 = 20\\%\\). Proportion who had a stroke in the control group: \\(28/227 = 0.12 = 12\\%\\). These two summary statistics are useful in looking for differences in the groups, and we are in for a surprise: an additional 8% of patients in the treatment group had a stroke! This is important for two reasons. First, it is contrary to what doctors expected, which was that stents would reduce the rate of strokes. Second, it leads to a statistical question: do the data show a “real” difference between the groups? This second question is subtle, and is the basis of what we call statistical inference. Suppose you flip a coin 100 times. While the chance a coin lands heads in any given coin flip is 50%, we probably won’t observe exactly 50 heads. This type of fluctuation is part of almost any type of data generating process. It is possible that the 8% difference in the stent study is due to this natural variation. However, the larger the difference we observe (for a particular sample size), the less believable it is that the difference is due to chance. So what we are really asking is the following: is the difference so large that we should reject the notion that it was due to chance? While we don’t yet have our statistical tools to fully address this question on our own, we can comprehend the conclusions of the published analysis: there was compelling evidence of harm by stents in this study of stroke patients. Be careful. Do not generalize the results of this study to all patients and all stents. This study looked at patients with very specific characteristics who volunteered to be a part of this study and who may not be representative of all stroke patients. In addition, there are many types of stents and this study only considered the self-expanding Wingspan stent (Boston Scientific). However, this study does leave us with an important lesson: we should keep our eyes open for surprises. 1.2 Data basics Effective presentation and description of data is a first step in most analyses. This section introduces one structure for organizing data as well as some terminology that will be used throughout this book. 1.2.1 Observations, variables, and data frames Here, we will consider loans offered through the Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending company. Such data could be used to explore characteristics of people receiving loans from the platform, such as job titles, annual income, or home ownership. Table 1.3 displays six rows of a data set for 50 randomly sampled loans. These observations will be referred to as the loan50 data set. The loan50 data can be found in the openintro package. Each row in the table represents a single loan. The formal name for a row is a case or observational unit. The columns represent characteristics of each loan, where each column is referred to as a variable. A variable is something that can be measured on an individual observational unit. Be careful not to confuse summary statistics—calculated from a group of observational units—with variables. For example, the first row represents a loan of $7,500 with an interest rate of 7.34%, where the borrower is based in Maryland (MD) and has an income of $70,000. What is the grade of the first loan in Table 1.3? And what is the home ownership status of the borrower for that first loan? Reminder: for these Guided Practice questions, you can check your answer in the footnote.4 In practice, it is especially important to ask clarifying questions to ensure important aspects of the data are understood. For instance, it is always important to be sure we know what each variable means and its units of measurement. Descriptions of the variables in the loan50 data set are given in Table 1.4. Table 1.3: Six rows from the loan50 data set loan_amount interest_rate term grade state total_income homeownership 1 22000 10.90 60 B NJ 59000 rent 2 6000 9.92 36 B CA 60000 rent 3 25000 26.30 36 E SC 75000 mortgage 4 6000 9.92 36 B CA 75000 rent 5 25000 9.43 60 B OH 254000 mortgage 6 6400 9.92 36 B IN 67000 mortgage Table 1.4: Variables and their descriptions for the loan50 data set. variable description loan_amount Amount of the loan received, in US dollars. interest_rate Interest rate on the loan, in an annual percentage. term The length of the loan, which is always set as a whole number of months. grade Loan grade, which takes a values A through G and represents the quality of the loan and its likelihood of being repaid. state US state where the borrower resides. total_income Borrower’s total income, including any second income, in US dollars. homeownership Indicates whether the person owns, owns but has a mortgage, or rents. The data in Table 1.3 represent a data frame (or data matrix), which is a convenient and common way to organize data, especially if collecting data in a spreadsheet. Each row of a data frame corresponds to a unique case (observational unit), and each column corresponds to a variable. When recording data, use a data frame unless you have a very good reason to use a different structure. This structure allows new cases to be added as rows or new variables as new columns. The grades for assignments, quizzes, and exams in a course are often recorded in a gradebook that takes the form of a data frame. How might you organize a course’s grade data using a data frame?5 We consider data for 3,142 counties in the United States, which include the name of each county, the state where it resides, its population in 2017, how its population changed from 2010 to 2017, poverty rate, and nine additional characteristics. How might these data be organized in a data frame?6 The data described in the Guided Practice above represent the county data set, which is shown as a data frame in Table 1.5. The variables as well as the variables in the data set that did not fit in Table 1.5 are described in Table 1.6 Table 1.5: Six observations and six variables from the county data set. name state pop2017 pop_change unemployment_rate median_edu Autauga County Alabama 55504 1.48 3.86 some_college Baldwin County Alabama 212628 9.19 3.99 some_college Barbour County Alabama 25270 -6.22 5.90 hs_diploma Bibb County Alabama 22668 0.73 4.39 hs_diploma Blount County Alabama 58013 0.68 4.02 hs_diploma Bullock County Alabama 10309 -2.28 4.93 hs_diploma Table 1.6: Variables and their descriptions for the county data set. variable description name Name of county. state Name of state. pop2000 Population in 2000. pop2010 Population in 2010. pop2017 Population in 2017. pop_change Population change from 2010 to 2017. poverty Percent of population in poverty in 2017. homeownership Homeownership rate, 2006-2010. multi_unit Percent of housing units in multi-unit structures, 2006-2010. unemployment_rate Unemployment rate in 2017. metro Whether the county contains a metropolitan area, taking one of the values yes or no. median_edu Median education level (2013-2017), taking one of the values below_hs, hs_diploma, some_college, or bachelors. per_capita_income Per capita (per person) income (2013-2017). median_hh_income Median household income. smoking_ban Describes whether the type of county-level smoking ban in place in 2010, taking one of the values none, partial, or comprehensive. The county data can be found in the openintro package. 1.2.2 Types of variables Examine the unemployment_rate, pop2017, state, metro, and median_edu variables in the county data set. Each of these variables is inherently different from the others, yet some share certain characteristics. First consider unemployment_rate, which is said to be a quantitative or numerical variable since it can take a wide range of numerical values, and it is sensible to add, subtract, or take averages with those values. On the other hand, we would not classify a variable reporting telephone area codes as quantitative since the average, sum, and difference of area codes doesn’t have any clear meaning. The pop2017 variable is also quantitative, although it seems to be a little different than unemployment_rate. This variable of the population count can only take whole non-negative numbers (0, 1, 2, …). For this reason, the population variable is said to be discrete since it can only take numerical values with jumps. On the other hand, the unemployment rate variable is said to be continuous. The variable state can take up to 51 values after accounting for Washington, DC: AL, AK, …, and WY. Because the responses themselves are categories, state is called a categorical variable, and the possible values are called the variable’s levels . The variable metro is also categorical, but it only has two levels (yes or no). A categorical variable with only two levels is called a binary variable. Finally, consider the median_edu variable, which describes the median education level of county residents and takes values below_hs, hs_diploma, some_college, or bachelors in each county. This variable seems to be a hybrid: it is a categorical variable but the levels have a natural ordering. A variable with these properties is called an ordinal variable, while a regular categorical variable without this type of special ordering is called a nominal variable. To simplify analyses, any ordinal variable in this book will be treated as a nominal (unordered) categorical variable. Figure 1.3: Breakdown of variables into their respective types. Data were collected about students in a statistics course. Three variables were recorded for each student: number of siblings, student height, and whether the student had previously taken a statistics course. Classify each of the variables as continuous quantitative, discrete quantitative, or categorical. The number of siblings and student height represent quantitative variables. Because the number of siblings is a count, it is discrete. Height varies continuously, so it is a continuous quantitative variable. The last variable classifies students into two categories—those who have and those who have not taken a statistics course—which makes this variable categorical. An experiment is evaluating the effectiveness of a new drug in treating migraines. A group variable is used to indicate the experiment group for each patient: treatment or control. The num_migraines variable represents the number of migraines the patient experienced during a 3-month period. Classify each variable as either quantitative or categorical?7 1.2.3 Relationships between variables Many analyses are motivated by a researcher looking for a relationship between two or more variables. A social scientist may like to answer some of the following questions: Does a higher than average increase in county population tend to correspond to counties with higher or lower median household incomes? If homeownership is lower than the national average in one county, will the percent of multi-unit structures in that county tend to be above or below the national average? How useful a predictor is median education level for the median household income for US counties? To answer these questions, data must be collected, such as the county data set shown in Table 1.5. Examining summary statistics could provide insights for each of the three questions about counties. Additionally, graphs can be used to visually explore the data. Scatterplots are one type of graph used to study the relationship between two quantitative variables. Figure 1.4 displays the relationship between the variables homeownership and multi_unit, which is the percent of units in multi-unit structures (e.g., apartments, condos). Each point on the plot represents a single county (a single observational unit). For instance, the highlighted dot corresponds to County 413 in the county data set: Chattahoochee County, Georgia, which has 39.4% of units in multi-unit structures and a homeownership rate of 31.3%. The scatterplot suggests a relationship between the two variables: counties with a higher rate of multi-units tend to have lower homeownership rates. We might brainstorm as to why this relationship exists and investigate each idea to determine which are the most reasonable explanations. Figure 1.4: A scatterplot of homeownership versus the percent of units that are in multi-unit structures for US counties. The highlighted dot represents Chattahoochee County, Georgia, which has a multi-unit rate of 39.4% and a homeownership rate of 31.3%. The multi-unit and homeownership rates are said to be associated because the plot shows a discernible pattern. When two variables show some connection with one another, they are called associated variables. Associated variables can also be called dependent variables and vice-versa. Examine the variables in the loan50 data set, which are described in Table 1.4. Create two questions about possible relationships between variables in loan50 that are of interest to you.8 This example examines the relationship between the change in population from 2010 to 2017 and median household income for counties, which is visualized as a scatterplot in Figure 1.5. Are these variables associated? The larger the median household income for a county, the higher the population growth observed for the county. While this trend isn’t true for every county, the trend in the plot is evident. Since there is some relationship between the variables, they are associated. Figure 1.5: A scatterplot showing pop_change against median_hh_income. Owsley County of Kentucky, is highlighted, which lost 3.63% of its population from 2010 to 2017 and had median household income of $22,736. Because there is a downward trend in Figure 1.4—counties with more units in multi-unit structures are associated with lower homeownership—these variables are said to be negatively associated. A positive association is shown in the relationship between the median_hh_income and pop_change variables in Figure 1.5, where counties with higher median household income tend to have higher rates of population growth. If two variables are not associated, then they are said to be independent. That is, two variables are independent if there is no evident relationship between the two. Associated or independent, not both. A pair of variables are either related in some way (associated) or not (independent). No pair of variables is both associated and independent. 1.2.4 Explanatory and response variables When we ask questions about the relationship between two variables, we sometimes also want to determine if the change in one variable causes a change in the other. Consider the following rephrasing of an earlier question bout the county data set: If there is an increase in the median household income in a county, does this drive an increase in its population? In this question, we are asking whether one variable affects another. If this is our underlying belief, then median household income is the explanatory variable variable and the population change is the response variable variable in the hypothesized relationship.9 Explanatory and response variables. When we suspect one variable might causally affect another, we label the first variable the explanatory variable and the second the response variable. explanatory variable \\(\\rightarrow\\) might affect \\(\\rightarrow\\) response variable For many pairs of variables, there is no hypothesized relationship, and these labels would not be applied to either variable in such cases. Bear in mind that the act of labeling the variables in this way does nothing to guarantee that a causal relationship exists. A formal evaluation to check whether one variable causes a change in another requires an experiment. 1.2.5 Introducing observational studies and experiments There are two primary types of data collection: observational studies and experiments. We already encountered an experiment in the case study in Section 1.1, and an observational study with the Lending Club data in this section. Researchers perform an observational study when they collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise. For instance, researchers may collect information via surveys, review medical or company records, or follow a cohort of many similar individuals to form hypotheses about why certain diseases might develop. In each of these situations, researchers merely observe the data that arise. In general, observational studies can provide evidence of a naturally occurring association between variables, but they cannot by themselves show a causal connection. When researchers want to investigate the possibility of a causal connection, they conduct an experiment. Usually there will be both an explanatory and a response variable. For instance, we may suspect administering a drug will reduce mortality in heart attack patients over the following year. To check if there really is a causal connection between the explanatory variable and the response, researchers will collect a sample of individuals and split them into groups. The individuals in each group are assigned a treatment. When individuals are randomly assigned to a group, the experiment is called a randomized experiment. For example, each heart attack patient in the drug trial could be randomly assigned, perhaps by flipping a coin, into one of two groups: the first group receives a placebo (fake treatment) and the second group receives the drug. Note that the case study in Section 1.1 did not use a placebo. Association \\(\\neq\\) Causation. In general, association does not imply causation, and causation can only be inferred from a randomized experiment. 1.3 Sampling principles and strategies The first step in conducting research is to identify topics or questions that are to be investigated. A clearly laid out research question is helpful in identifying what subjects or cases should be studied and what variables are important. It is also important to consider how data are collected so that they are reliable and help achieve the research goals. 1.3.1 Populations and samples Consider the following three research questions: What is the average mercury content in swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean? Over the last 5 years, what is the average time to complete a degree for Duke undergrads? Does a new drug reduce the risk deaths in patients with severe heart disease? Each research question refers to a target population. In the first question, the target population is all swordfish in the Atlantic ocean, and each fish represents a case. Often times, it is too expensive to collect data for every case in a population. Instead, a sample is taken. A sample represents a subset of the cases and is often a small fraction of the population. For instance, 60 swordfish (or some other number) in the population might be selected, and this sample data may be used to provide an estimate of the population average and answer the research question. For the second and third questions above, identify the target population and what represents an individual case.10 1.3.2 Anecdotal evidence Consider the following possible responses to the three research questions: A man on the news got mercury poisoning from eating swordfish, so the average mercury concentration in swordfish must be dangerously high. I met two students who took more than 7 years to graduate from Duke, so it must take longer to graduate at Duke than at many other colleges. My friend’s dad had a heart attack and died after they gave him a new heart disease drug, so the drug must not work. Each conclusion is based on data. However, there are two problems. First, the data only represent one or two cases. Second, and more importantly, it is unclear whether these cases are actually representative of the population. Data collected in this haphazard fashion are called anecdotal evidence. Anecdotal evidence. Be careful of data collected in a haphazard fashion. Such evidence may be true and verifiable, but it may only represent extraordinary cases. Figure 1.6: In February 2010, some media pundits cited one large snow storm as evidence against global warming. As comedian Jon Stewart pointed out, “It is one storm, in one region, of one country.” Anecdotal evidence typically is composed of unusual cases that we recall based on their striking characteristics. For instance, we are more likely to remember the two people we met who took 7 years to graduate than the six others who graduated in four years. Instead of looking at the most unusual cases, we should examine a sample of many cases that better represent the population. 1.3.3 Sampling from a population We might try to estimate the time to graduation for Duke undergraduates in the last 5 years by collecting a sample of students. All graduates in the last 5 years represent the population, and graduates who are selected for review are collectively called the sample. In general, we always seek to randomly select a sample from a population. The most basic type of random selection is equivalent to how raffles are conducted–where each raffle ticket has an equal chance of being selected. For example, in selecting graduates, we could write each graduate’s name on a raffle ticket and draw 100 tickets. The selected names would represent a random sample of 100 graduates. We pick samples randomly to reduce the chance we introduce biases. Figure 1.7: In this graphic, five graduates are randomly selected from the population (all graduates in the last 5 years) to be included in the sample. Suppose we ask a student who happens to be majoring in nutrition to select several graduates for the study. What kind of students do you think they might collect? Do you think their sample would be representative of all graduates? Perhaps they would pick a disproportionate number of graduates from health-related fields. Or perhaps their selection would be a good representation of the population. When selecting samples by hand, we run the risk of picking a biased sample, even if our bias is unintended. Figure 1.8: Asked to pick a sample of graduates, a nutrition major might inadvertently pick a disproportionate number of graduates from health-related majors. If someone was permitted to pick and choose exactly which graduates were included in the sample, it is entirely possible that the sample could be skewed to that person’s interests, which may be entirely unintentional. This introduces bias into a sampling method. There are three common types of sampling bias we will discuss: Selection bias: the method in how your sample is selected tends to produce samples that either over-represent or under-represent certain portions of the population. Non-response bias: individuals selected for the sample are unwilling or cannot respond. Response bias: individuals selected for the sample respond in a way that does not accurately represent the truth—due to question wording, lack of anonymity, or other issues. A common downfall in survey studies is a convenience sample, where individuals who are easily accessible are more likely to be included in the sample. For instance, if a political survey is done by stopping people walking in the Bronx, this will not represent all of New York City. It is often difficult to discern what sub-population a convenience sample represents. Is a convenience sample an example of selection bias, non-response bias, or response bias?11 Sampling randomly helps resolve selection bias. The most basic random sample is called a simple random sample, and is equivalent to using a raffle to select cases. This means that each case in the population has an equal chance of being included and there is no implied connection between the cases in the sample. Even when people are picked at random, however, caution must be exercised if the non-response rate is high, or if response bias is present. For instance, if only 30% of the people randomly sampled for a survey actually respond, then it is unclear whether the results are representative of the entire population. This non-response bias can produce results in the sample that do not accurately reflect the entire population. Figure 1.9: Due to the possibility of non-response, survey studies may only reach a certain group within the population. It is difficult, and often times impossible, to completely fix this problem. Asking the uninformed. Popular late night host Jimmy Kimmel has a segment on his show called “Lie Witness News,” where Kimmel’s staff take to the streets to ask pedestrians about recent stories in the news. However, these recent stories are not really stories at all—they’re fake. Without fail, those asked always express an opinion, unflinchingly. Why? People do not like to appear as if they don’t know what they’re talking about, so we make up answers. For an entertaining display of this fascinating psychological example of response bias, watch the Coachella 2013 episode of Lie Witness News. We can easily access ratings for products, sellers, and companies through websites. These ratings are based only on those people who go out of their way to provide a rating. If 50% of online reviews for a product are negative, do you think this means that 50% of buyers are dissatisfied with the product? Why or why not?12 1.3.4 Four sampling methods (special topic) Almost all statistical methods are based on the notion of implied randomness. If observational data are not collected in a random framework from a population, these statistical methods—the estimates and errors associated with the estimates—are not reliable. Here we consider four random sampling techniques: simple, stratified, cluster, and multistage sampling. Figures 1.10 and 1.11 provide graphical representations of these techniques. Figure 1.10: Examples of simple random and stratified sampling. In the top panel, simple random sampling was used to randomly select the 18 cases (denoted in red). In the bottom panel, stratified sampling was used: cases were grouped into strata, then simple random sampling was employed to randomly select 3 cases within each stratum. Simple random sampling is probably the most intuitive form of random sampling. Consider the salaries of Major League Baseball (MLB) players, where each player is a member of one of the league’s 30 teams. To take a simple random sample of 120 baseball players and their salaries, we could write the names of that season’s several hundreds of players onto slips of paper, drop the slips into a bucket, shake the bucket around until we are sure the names are all mixed up, then draw out slips until we have the sample of 120 players. In general, a sample is referred to as “simple random” if each case in the population has an equal chance of being included in the final sample and knowing that a case is included in a sample does not provide useful information about which other cases are included. Stratified sampling is a divide-and-conquer sampling strategy. The population is divided into groups called strata. The strata are chosen so that similar cases are grouped together, then a second sampling method, usually simple random sampling, is employed within each stratum. In the baseball salary example, each of the 30 teams could represent a strata, since some teams have a lot more money (up to 4 times as much!). Then we might randomly sample 4 players from each team for our sample of 120 players. Stratified sampling is especially useful when the cases in each stratum are very similar with respect to the outcome of interest. The downside is that analyzing data from a stratified sample is a more complex task than analyzing data from a simple random sample. The analysis methods introduced in this book would need to be extended to analyze data collected using stratified sampling. Why would it be good for cases within each stratum to be very similar? We might get a more stable estimate for the subpopulation in a stratum if the cases are very similar, leading to more precise estimates within each group. When we combine these estimates into a single estimate for the full population, that population estimate will tend to be more precise since each individual group estimate is itself more precise. In a cluster sample, we break up the population into many groups, called clusters. Then we sample a fixed number of clusters and include all observations from each of those clusters in the sample. A multistage sample is like a cluster sample, but rather than keeping all observations in each cluster, we would collect a random sample within each selected cluster. Figure 1.11: Examples of cluster and multistage sampling. In the top panel, cluster sampling was used: data were binned into nine clusters, three of these clusters were sampled, and all observations within these three cluster were included in the sample. In the bottom panel, multistage sampling was used, which differs from cluster sampling only in that we randomly select a subset of each cluster to be included in the sample rather than measuring every case in each sampled cluster. Sometimes cluster or multistage sampling can be more economical than the alternative sampling techniques. Also, unlike stratified sampling, these approaches are most helpful when there is a lot of case-to-case variability within a cluster but the clusters themselves don’t look very different from one another. For example, if neighborhoods represented clusters, then cluster or multistage sampling work best when the neighborhoods are very diverse. A~downside of these methods is that more advanced techniques are typically required to analyze the data, though the methods in this book can be extended to handle such data. Suppose we are interested in estimating the malaria rate in a densely tropical portion of rural Indonesia. We learn that there are 30 villages in that part of the Indonesian jungle, each more or less similar to the next, but the distances between the villages is substantial. Our goal is to test 150 individuals for malaria. What sampling method should be employed? A simple random sample would likely draw individuals from all 30 villages, which could make data collection extremely expensive. Stratified sampling would be a challenge since it is unclear how we would build strata of similar individuals. However, cluster sampling or multistage sampling seem like very good ideas. If we decided to use multistage sampling, we might randomly select half of the villages, then randomly select 10 people from each. This would probably reduce our data collection costs substantially in comparison to a simple random sample, and the cluster sample would still give us reliable information, even if we would need to analyze the data with slightly more advanced methods than we discuss in this book. 1.4 Observational studies Data where no treatment has been explicitly applied (or explicitly withheld) is called observational data. For instance, the loan data and county data described in Section 1.2 are both examples of observational data. O bservational studies are generally only sufficient to show associations or form hypotheses that can be later checked with experiments. Making causal conclusions based on experiments is often reasonable. However, making the same causal conclusions based on observational data can be treacherous and is not recommended. Indeed, making causal conclusions based on observational data is arguably the most common mistake in our news headlines and social media posts! Suppose an observational study tracked sunscreen use and skin cancer, and it was found that the more sunscreen someone used, the more likely the person was to have skin cancer. Does this mean sunscreen causes skin cancer?13 Some previous research tells us that using sunscreen actually reduces skin cancer risk, so maybe there is another variable that can explain this hypothetical association between sunscreen usage and skin cancer. One important piece of information that is absent is sun exposure. If someone is out in the sun all day, they are more likely to use sunscreen and more likely to get skin cancer. Exposure to the sun is unaccounted for in the simple investigation. Sun exposure is what is called a confounding variable14, which is a variable that is associated with both the explanatory and response variables. While one method to justify making causal conclusions from observational studies is to exhaust the search for confounding variables, there is no guarantee that all confounding variables can be examined or measured. A confounding variable is a variable that is both associated with the explanatory variable, and associated with the response variable. When both these conditions are met, if we observe an association between the explanatory variable and the response variable in the data, we cannot be sure if this association is due to the explanatory variable or the confounding variable—the explanatory and confounding variables are “confounded.” Figure 1.4 shows a negative association between the homeownership rate and the percentage of multi-unit structures in a county. However, it is unreasonable to conclude that there is a causal relationship between the two variables. Suggest a variable that might explain the negative relationship.15 Houndstongue (a noxious weed) is found in abundance on private and public lands that have been grazed by cattle. Houndstongue is rarely found on lands that have been grazed by mountain goats. One investigator concluded that houndstongue infestations could be reduced by importing mountain goats to the infested areas. What is wrong with this conclusion?16 Observational studies come in two forms: prospective and retrospective studies. A prospective study identifies individuals and collects information as events unfold. For instance, medical researchers may identify and follow a group of patients over many years to assess the possible influences of behavior on cancer risk. One example of such a study is The Nurses’ Health Study. Started in 1976 and expanded in 1989, the Nurses’ Health Study has collected data on over 275,000 nurses and is still enrolling participants. This prospective study recruits registered nurses and then collects data from them using questionnaires. Retrospective studies collect data after events have taken place, e.g. researchers may review past events in medical records. Some data sets may contain both prospectively- and retrospectively-collected variables, such as medical studies which gather information on participants’ lives before they enter the study and subsequently collect data on participants throughout the study. 1.5 Experiments Studies where the researchers assign treatments to cases are called experiments. When this assignment includes randomization, e.g., using a coin flip to decide which treatment a patient receives, it is called a randomized experiment. Randomized experiments are fundamentally important when trying to show a causal connection between two variables. 1.5.1 Principles of experimental design Controlling. Researchers assign treatments to cases, and they do their best to control any other differences in the groups17. For example, when patients take a drug in pill form, some patients take the pill with only a sip of water while others may have it with an entire glass of water. To control for the effect of water consumption, a doctor may instruct every patient to drink a 12 ounce glass of water with the pill. Randomization. Researchers randomize patients into treatment groups to account for variables that cannot be controlled. For example, some patients may be more susceptible to a disease than others due to their dietary habits. Randomizing patients into the treatment or control group helps even out such differences, and it also prevents accidental bias from entering the study. Replication. The more cases researchers observe, the more accurately they can estimate the effect of the explanatory variable on the response. In a single study, we replicate by collecting a sufficiently large sample. Alternatively, a group of scientists may replicate an entire study to verify an earlier finding. Randomized experiments are generally built on four principles: Blocking. Researchers sometimes know or suspect that variables, other than the treatment, influence the response. Under these circumstances, they may first group individuals based on this variable into blocks and then randomize cases within each block to the treatment groups. This strategy is often referred to as blocking. For instance, if we are looking at the effect of a drug on heart attacks, we might first split patients in the study into low-risk and high-risk blocks, then randomly assign half the patients from each block to the control group and the other half to the treatment group, as shown in Figure 1.12. This strategy ensures each treatment group has an equal number of low-risk and high-risk patients. Figure 1.12: Blocking using a variable depicting patient risk. Patients are first divided into low-risk and high-risk blocks, then each block is evenly separated into the treatment groups using randomization. This strategy ensures an equal representation of patients in each treatment group from both the low-risk and high-risk categories. It is important to incorporate the first three experimental design principles into any study, and this book describes applicable methods for analyzing data from such experiments. Blocking is a slightly more advanced technique, and statistical methods in this book may be extended to analyze data collected using blocking. 1.5.2 Reducing bias in human experiments Randomized experiments have long been considered to be the gold standard for data collection, but they do not ensure an unbiased perspective into the cause and effect relationship in all cases. Human studies are perfect examples where bias can unintentionally arise. Here we reconsider a study where a new drug was used to treat heart attack patients. In particular, researchers wanted to know if the drug reduced deaths in patients. These researchers designed a randomized experiment because they wanted to draw causal conclusions about the drug’s effect. Study volunteers18 were randomly placed into two study groups. One group, the treatment group, received the drug. The other group, called the control group, did not receive any drug treatment. Put yourself in the place of a person in the study. If you are in the treatment group, you are given a fancy new drug that you anticipate will help you. On the other hand, a person in the other group doesn’t receive the drug and sits idly, hoping her participation doesn’t increase her risk of death. These perspectives suggest there are actually two effects in this study: the one of interest is the effectiveness of the drug, and the second is an emotional effect to (not) taking the drug, which is difficult to quantify. Researchers aren’t usually interested in the emotional effect, which might bias the study. To circumvent this problem, researchers do not want patients to know which group they are in. When researchers keep the patients uninformed about their treatment, the study is said to be blind. But there is one problem: if a patient doesn’t receive a treatment, they will know they’re in the control group. The solution to this problem is to give fake treatments to patients in the control group. A fake treatment is called a placebo, and an effective placebo is the key to making a study truly blind. A classic example of a placebo is a sugar pill that is made to look like the actual treatment pill. Often times, a placebo results in a slight but real improvement in patients. This effect has been dubbed the placebo effect. The patients are not the only ones who should be blinded: doctors and researchers can accidentally bias a study. When a doctor knows a patient has been given the real treatment, they might inadvertently give that patient more attention or care than a patient that they know is on the placebo. To guard against this bias, which again has been found to have a measurable effect in some instances, most modern studies employ a double-blind setup where doctors or researchers who interact with patients are, just like the patients, unaware of who is or is not receiving the treatment.19 Look back to the study in Section 1.1 where researchers were testing whether stents were effective at reducing strokes in at-risk patients. Is this an experiment? Was the study blinded? Was it double-blinded?20 For the study in Section 1.1, could the researchers have employed a placebo? If so, what would that placebo have looked like?21 You may have many questions about the ethics of sham surgeries to create a placebo. These questions may have even arisen in your mind when in the general experiment context, where a possibly helpful treatment was withheld from individuals in the control group; the main difference is that a sham surgery tends to create additional risk, while withholding a treatment only maintains a person’s risk. There are always multiple viewpoints of experiments and placebos, and rarely is it obvious which is ethically “correct”. For instance, is it ethical to use a sham surgery when it creates a risk to the patient? However, if we don’t use sham surgeries, we may promote the use of a costly treatment that has no real effect; if this happens, money and other resources will be diverted away from other treatments that are known to be helpful. Ultimately, this is a difficult situation where we cannot perfectly protect both the patients who have volunteered for the study and the patients who may benefit (or not) from the treatment in the future. 1.6 Scope of inference When statisticians refer to the scope of inference of a study, we are asking two questions: Generalizability: To which population can we generalize these results? Causation: Do these results provide evidence for a causal relationship? The answer to the first question is determined by the sampling method—if we selected our sample randomly, and there are no other sources of sampling bias, then we can reasonably generalize to the population from which the sample was taken. The answer to the second question is determined by the type of study—if the study is a randomized experiment, then it can investigate whether changes in the explanatory variable caused changes in the response variable; in an observational study, one can only investigate associations between the variables. We summarize how to determine a study’s scope of inference in Figure 1.13. Figure 1.13: Determining scope of inference of a study. 1.7 Data in R R is a powerful and open source software tool for working with data. Throughout this text, we provide some guidance on how to use R within the context of the statistical content that is being covered. As educators, we see the value of teaching with modern software to empower students to take optimal advantage of the concepts they are learning. However, we understand the limitations of some educational structures, and we know that not every classroom will be able to implement R alongside the statistical concepts. Generally, we will present the R techniques at the end of each chapter. There are times in the text when the concepts are not distinguishable from the software, and in those cases, we have have provided the R code within the main body of the chapter. We start with an introduction to R, focused on how data sets are structured in R and how the user can work with a data object in R. 1.7.1 Dataframes in R Throughout the text, we will work with many different data sets. Some data sets are pre-loaded into R, some get loaded through R packages, and some data sets will be created by the student. data sets can be viewed through the RStudio environment, but the data can also be investigated through the notebook features of an RMarkdown file. Consider the data that was described previously in this chapter. We can use the glimpse() function to see the variables included in the data set and their data type. Or, we could use the head() function to see the first few rows of the data set. data(email50) glimpse(email50) #&gt; Rows: 50 #&gt; Columns: 21 #&gt; $ spam &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,… #&gt; $ to_multiple &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,… #&gt; $ from &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,… #&gt; $ cc &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,… #&gt; $ sent_email &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1,… #&gt; $ time &lt;dttm&gt; 2012-01-04 06:19:16, 2012-02-16 13:10:06, 2012-01-04 08… #&gt; $ image &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,… #&gt; $ attach &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,… #&gt; $ dollar &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 23, 4, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0… #&gt; $ winner &lt;fct&gt; no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes, no,… #&gt; $ inherit &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,… #&gt; $ viagra &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,… #&gt; $ password &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8,… #&gt; $ num_char &lt;dbl&gt; 21.705, 7.011, 0.631, 2.454, 41.623, 0.057, 0.809, 5.229… #&gt; $ line_breaks &lt;int&gt; 551, 183, 28, 61, 1088, 5, 17, 88, 242, 578, 1167, 198, … #&gt; $ format &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1,… #&gt; $ re_subj &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0,… #&gt; $ exclaim_subj &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,… #&gt; $ urgent_subj &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,… #&gt; $ exclaim_mess &lt;dbl&gt; 8, 1, 2, 1, 43, 0, 0, 2, 22, 3, 13, 1, 2, 2, 21, 10, 0, … #&gt; $ number &lt;fct&gt; small, big, none, small, small, small, small, small, sma… head(email50) #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 21 #&gt; spam to_multiple from cc sent_email time image attach #&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 0 0 1 0 1 2012-01-04 06:19:16 0 0 #&gt; 2 0 0 1 0 0 2012-02-16 13:10:06 0 0 #&gt; 3 1 0 1 4 0 2012-01-04 08:36:23 0 2 #&gt; 4 0 0 1 0 0 2012-01-04 10:49:52 0 0 #&gt; 5 0 0 1 0 0 2012-01-27 02:34:45 0 0 #&gt; 6 0 0 1 0 0 2012-01-17 10:31:57 0 0 #&gt; # … with 13 more variables: dollar &lt;dbl&gt;, winner &lt;fct&gt;, inherit &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # viagra &lt;dbl&gt;, password &lt;dbl&gt;, num_char &lt;dbl&gt;, line_breaks &lt;int&gt;, #&gt; # format &lt;dbl&gt;, re_subj &lt;dbl&gt;, exclaim_subj &lt;dbl&gt;, urgent_subj &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # exclaim_mess &lt;dbl&gt;, number &lt;fct&gt; Sometimes it is necessary to extract a column or a row from a data set. In R, the $ operator can be used to extract a column from a data set. For example, data$variable would extract the variable column from the data dataframe. When extracted, these columns can be thought of as vectors. With these vectors, if you desired to pull off a specific entry, you could use square brackets ([ ]), with the index (number) of the entry you wish to extract in the brackets. For example, data$variable[2] would extract the second entry (row) of the variable column. Because a dataframe can be (roughly) thought of as a set of many different vectors, you can extract rows and columns from a dataframe using familiar matrix notation (e.g. [row, column]. For example data[i,j] will extract the \\((i,j)^{th}\\) entry of data, data[i, ] will extract the \\(i^{th}\\) row, and data[ , j] will extract the \\(j^{th}\\) column. Notice, when extracting an entire row (or column), you do not need to specify the columns (or rows) you would like, which is why the second entry does not contain a number. email50$num_char #&gt; [1] 21.705 7.011 0.631 2.454 41.623 0.057 0.809 5.229 9.277 17.170 #&gt; [11] 64.401 10.368 42.793 0.451 29.233 9.794 2.139 0.130 4.945 11.533 #&gt; [21] 5.682 6.768 0.086 3.070 26.520 26.255 5.259 2.780 5.864 9.928 #&gt; [31] 25.209 6.563 24.599 25.757 0.409 11.223 3.778 1.493 10.613 0.493 #&gt; [41] 4.415 14.156 9.491 24.837 0.684 13.502 2.789 1.169 8.937 15.829 email50[47,3] #&gt; # A tibble: 1 x 1 #&gt; from #&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 1 Table 1.7: Data from the 47th row of the email data set. spam to_multiple from cc sent_email time image attach dollar winner inherit viagra password num_char line_breaks format re_subj exclaim_subj urgent_subj exclaim_mess number 0 1 1 2 0 2012-01-02 14:24:21 0 0 0 no 0 0 0 8.72 185 0 1 0 0 3 small 1.7.2 Tidy structure of data For plotting, analyses, model building, etc., the data should be structured according to certain principles. Hadley Wickham provides a thorough discussion and advice for cleaning up the data in Wickham and others (2014). Tidy data: rows (cases/observational units) and columns (variables). The key is that every row is a case and every column is a variable. No exceptions. Creating tidy data is often not trivial. Within R (really within any type of computing language, Python, SQL, Java, etc.), it is important to understand how to build data using the patterns of the language. Some things to consider: object_name &lt;- anything is a way of assigning anything to the new object_name. object_name &lt;- function_name(data_table, arguments) is a way of using a function to create a new object. object_name &lt;- data_table %&gt;% function_name(arguments) uses chaining syntax as an extension of the ideas of functions. In chaining, the value on the left side of %&gt;% becomes the first argument to the function on the right side. object_name &lt;- data_table %&gt;% function_name(arguments) %&gt;% another_function_name(other_arguments) is extended chaining. %&gt;% is never at the front of the line, it is always connecting one idea with the continuation of that idea on the next line. * In R, all functions take arguments in round parentheses (as opposed to subsetting observations or variables from data objects which happen with square parentheses). Additionally, the spot to the left of %&gt;% is always a data table. * The pipe syntax should be read as then, %&gt;%. 1.7.3 Using the pipe to chain The pipe syntax (%&gt;%) takes a data frame (or data table) and sends it to the argument of a function. The mapping goes to the first available argument in the function. For example: x %&gt;% f(y) is the same as f(x, y) y %&gt;% f(x, ., z) is the same as f(x,y,z) Pipes are used commonly with functions in the dplyr package (see R examples in Chapter 2) and they allow us to sequentially build data wrangling operations. We’ll start with short pipes and throughout the course build up to longer pipes that perform multiple operations. Consider the data, High School and Beyond survey. Two hundred observations were randomly sampled from the High School and Beyond survey, a survey conducted on high school seniors by the National Center of Education Statistics. Of interest is the proportion of students at each of the two types of school, public and privaate. We use the table command to tabulate how many of each type of school are in the data set. Notice that the same result is produced by the $ command with table and the chaining syntax done with %&gt;%. data(hsb2) table(hsb2$schtyp) #&gt; #&gt; public private #&gt; 168 32 hsb2 %&gt;% select(schtyp) %&gt;% table() #&gt; . #&gt; public private #&gt; 168 32 What if we are interested only in public schools? First, we should take note of another piece of R syntax: the double equal sign. This is the logical test for “is equal to”. In other words, we first determine if school type is equal to public for each of the observations in the data set and filter for those where this is true. # Filter for public schools hsb2_public &lt;- hsb2 %&gt;% filter(schtyp == &quot;public&quot;) We can read this as: “take the hsb2 data frame and pipe it into the filter function. Filter the data for cases where school type is equal to public. Then, assign the resulting data frame to a new object called hsb2 underscore public.” Suppose we are not interested in the actual reading score of students, but instead whether their reading score is below average or at or above average. First, we need to calculate the average reading score with the mean function. This will give us the mean value, 52.23. However, in order to be able to refer back to this value later on, we might want to store it as an object that we can refer to by name. # Calculate average reading score and show the value mean(hsb2$read) #&gt; [1] 52.2 So instead of just printing the result, let’s save it as a new object called avg_read. # Calculate average reading score and store as avg_read avg_read &lt;- mean(hsb2$read) Before we more on, a quick tip: most often you’ll want to do both; see the value and also store it for later use. The approach we used here, running the mean function twice, is redundant. Instead, you can simply wrap your assignment code in parentheses so that R will not only assign the average value of reading test scores to avg read, but it will also print out its value. # Do both (avg_read &lt;- mean(hsb2$read)) #&gt; [1] 52.2 Next we need to determine whether each student is below or at or above average. For example, a reading score of 57 is above average, so is 68, but 44 is below. Obviously, going through each record like this would be tedious and error prone. Instead we can create this new variable with the mutate function from the dplyr package. We start with the data frame, hsb2, and pipe it into mutate, to create a new variable called read_cat (cat for categorical). Note that we are using a new variable name here in order to not overwrite the existing reading score variable. The new variable read_cat will be a column in the existing data frame hsb2. To indicate that the mutate function came from the dplyr package, we use the pacakge::function syntax. It is not usually necessary to provide the package name (unless there is ambiguity about where the function came from). hsb2 &lt;- hsb2 %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(read_cat = ifelse(read &lt; avg_read, &quot;below average&quot;, &quot;at or above average&quot;)) The decision criteria for this new variable is based on a TRUE/FALSE question: if the reading score of the student is below the average reading score, label “below average”, otherwise, label “at or above average”. This can be accomplished using the ifelse function in R. The first argument of the function is the logical test. The second argument is what to do if the result of the logical test is TRUE, in other words, if the student’s score is below the average score, and the last argument is what to do if the result is FALSE. The ifelse function can be used for more complicated discretization rules as well, by nesting many ifelse statements within each other. This is not necessary for this example, but it will come up later in the course. Add link to tutorial. 1.8 Chapter review 1.8.1 Terms We introduced the following terms in the chapter.

We use statistical software for generating the summaries and graphs presented in this chapter and book. However, since this might be your first exposure to these concepts, we take our time in this chapter to detail how to create them. Mastery of the content presented in this chapter will be crucial for understanding the methods and techniques introduced in rest of the book. 2.1 Exploring categorical data In this section, we will introduce tables and other basic tools for organizing and analyzing categorical data that are used throughout this book. The loan50 data set represents a sample from a larger loan data set called loans. This larger data set contains information on 10,000 loans made through Lending Club. We will examine the relationship between homeownership, which for the loans data can take a value of rent, mortgage (owns but has a mortgage), or own, and app_type, which indicates whether the loan application was made with a partner or whether it was an individual application. 2.1.1 Contingency tables and conditional proportions One-way and Two-way/contingency tables Define frequencies/counts and relative frequencies/proportions p-hat and pi notation association vs no association in conditional proportions Bayes theorem with tables and trees - conditional vs unconditional probabilities COPIED AND PASTED FROM EARLIER The mean is useful because it allows us to rescale or standardize a metric into something more easily interpretable and comparable. Suppose we would like to understand if a new drug is more effective at treating asthma attacks than the standard drug. A trial of 1500 adults is set up, where 500 receive the new drug, and 1000 receive a standard drug in the control group: New drug Standard drug Number of patients 500 1000 Total asthma attacks 200 300 Comparing the raw counts of 200 to 300 asthma attacks would make it appear that the new drug is better, but this is an artifact of the imbalanced group sizes. Instead, we should look at the average number of asthma attacks per patient in each group: New drug: \\(200 / 500 = 0.4\\) asthma attacks per patient Standard drug: \\(300 / 1000 = 0.3\\) asthma attacks per patient The standard drug has a lower average number of asthma attacks per patient than the average in the treatment group. END COPIED AND PASTED SECTION Table 2.1 summarizes two variables: Type (spam or not spam) and Number. Number is a categorical variable that describes whether an email contains no numbers, only small numbers (values under 1 million), or at least one big number (a value of 1 million or more). A table that summarizes data for two categorical variables in this way is called a contingency table or two-way table. Each value in the table represents the number of times, or frequency a particular combination of variable outcomes occurred. For example, the value 149 corresponds to the number of emails in the data set that are spam and had no number listed in the email. Row and column totals are also included. The row totals provide the total counts across each row (e.g., \\(149 + 168 + 50 = 367\\)), and column totals are total counts down each column. A table for a single variable is called a frequency table. Table 2.2 is a frequency table for the Number variable. If we replaced the counts with percentages or proportions, the table would be called a relative frequency table. Table 2.1: Contingency table of Type and Number variables. none small big Total spam 149 168 50 367 not spam 400 2659 495 3554 Total 549 2827 545 3921 Table 2.2: Frequency table of Number variable. none small big 549 2827 545 2.1.2 Bar plots and mosaic plots one cat bar plot two cat bar plot two cat mosaic plot association vs no association in bar plots 2.1.3 Why not pie charts? If you’re still not convinced, read this post on the “from Data to Viz” blog: “The Issue with Pie Chart”. 2.2 Exploring quantitative data In this section we will explore techniques for summarizing quantitative variables. For example, consider the loan_amount variable from the loan50 data set, which represents the loan size for all 50 loans in the data set. This variable is quantitative since we can sensibly discuss the numerical difference of the size of two loans. On the other hand, area codes and zip codes are not quantitative, but rather they are categorical variables. Throughout this section and the next, we will apply these methods using the loan50, county, and email50 data sets, which were introduced in Section 1.2. If you’d like to review the variables from either data set, see Tables 1.4 and 1.6. The loan50 and email50 data sets can be found in the openintro package. The county data can be found in the usdata package. 2.2.1 Scatterplots for paired data A scatterplot provides a case-by-case view of data for two quantitative variables. In Figure 1.4, a scatterplot was used to examine the homeownership rate against the fraction of housing units that were part of multi-unit properties (e.g. apartments) in the county data set. Another scatterplot is shown in Figure 2.1, comparing the total income of a borrower total_income and the amount they borrowed loan_amount for the loan50 data set. In any scatterplot, each point represents a single case. Since there are 50 cases in loan50, there are 50 points in Figure 2.1. When examining scatterplots, we describe four features: Form - If you were to trace the trend of the points, would the trend be linear or nonlinear? Direction - As values on the x-axis increase, do the y-values tend to increase (positive direction) or do they decrease (negative direction)? Strength - How closely to the points follow a trend? Unusual observations or outliers- Are there any unusual observations that do not seem to match the overall pattern of the scatterplot? Figure 2.1: A scatterplot of loan_amount versus total_income for the loan50 data set. Looking at Figure 2.1, we see that there are many borrowers with income below $100,000 on the left side of the graph, while there are a handful of borrowers with income above $250,000. The loan amounts vary from below $10,000 to around $40,000. The data seem to have a linear form, though the relationship between the two variables is quite weak. The direction is positive—as total income increases, the loan amount also tends to increase—and there may be a few unusual observations in the higher income range, though since the relationship is weak, it is hard to tell. Figure 2.2: A scatterplot of the median household income against the poverty rate for the county data set. Data are from 2017. A statistical model has also been fit to the data and is shown as a dashed line. Figure 2.2 shows a plot of median household income against the poverty rate for r nrow(county) counties. What can be said about the relationship between these variables? The relationship is evidently nonlinear, as highlighted by the dashed line. This is different from previous scatterplots we have seen, which show relationships that do not show much, if any, curvature in the trend. The relationship is moderate to strong, the direction is negative, and there does not appear to be any unusual observations. What do scatterplots reveal about the data, and how are they useful?22 Describe two variables that would have a horseshoe-shaped association in a scatterplot (\\(\\cap\\) or \\(\\frown\\))23 2.2.2 Dot plots and the mean Sometimes we are interested in the distribution of a single variable. In these cases, a dot plot provides the most basic of displays. A dot plot is a one-variable scatterplot; an example using the interest rate of 50 loans is shown in Figure 2.3. Figure 2.3: A dot plot of interest_rate for the loan50 data set. The rates have been rounded to the nearest percent in this plot, and the distribution’s mean is shown as a red triangle. The distribution of a variable is a description of the possible values it takes and how frequently each value occurs. The mean, often called the average, is a common way to measure the center of a distribution of data. To compute the mean interest rate of the 50 loans above, we add up all the interest rates and divide by the number of observations. The sample mean is often labeled \\(\\bar{x}\\). The letter \\(x\\) is being used as a generic placeholder for the variable and the bar over the \\(x\\) communicates we’re looking at the average of that variable. In our example \\(x\\) would represent interest rate, and \\(\\bar{x}\\) = 11.57%. It is useful to think of the mean as the balancing point of the distribution24, and it’s shown as a triangle in Figure 2.3. Mean. The sample mean can be calculated as the sum of the observed values divided by the number of observations: \\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n}{n} \\] Examine the equation for the mean. What does \\(x_1\\) correspond to? And \\(x_2\\) Can you infer a general meaning to what \\(x_i\\) might represent?25 What was \\(n\\) in this sample of loans?26 The loan50 data set represents a sample from a larger population of loans made through Lending Club. We could compute a mean for this population in the same way as the sample mean. However, the population mean has a special label: \\(\\mu\\). The symbol \\(\\mu\\) is the Greek letter mu and represents the average of all observations in the population. Sometimes a subscript, such as \\(_x\\), is used to represent which variable the population mean refers to, e.g., \\(\\mu_x\\). Often times it is too expensive or time consuming to measure the population mean precisely, so we often estimate \\(\\mu\\) using the sample mean, \\(\\bar{x}\\). The Greek letter \\(\\mu\\) is pronounced mu, listen to the pronunciation here. In the field of statistics, summary measures that summarize a sample of data, such as \\(\\bar{x}\\), are called statistics. Numbers that summarize an entire population, such as \\(\\mu\\), are called parameters. You can remember this distinction by looking at the first letter of each term: Statistics summarize Samples; Parameters summarize Populations. We typically use Roman letters to symbolize statistics (e.g., \\(\\bar{x}\\), \\(\\hat{p}\\)), and Greek letters to symbolize parameters (e.g., \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\pi\\)). Since we rarely can measure the entire population, and thus rarely know the actual parameter values, we like to say, “We don’t know Greek, and we don’t know parameters!” The average interest rate across all loans in the population can be estimated using the sample data. Based on the sample of 50 loans, what would be a reasonable estimate of \\(\\mu_x\\), the mean interest rate for all loans in the full data set? The sample mean, r {round(loan50_mean_intrest_rate, 2)}, provides a rough estimate of \\(\\mu_x\\). While it is not perfect, this statistic our single best guess point estimate of the average interest rate of all the loans in the population under study, the parameter. In Chapter ?? and beyond, we will develop tools to characterize the accuracy of point estimates, like the sample mean. As you might have guessed, point estimates based on larger samples tend to be more accurate than those based on smaller samples. The mean is useful for making comparisons across different samples that may have different sample sizes by converting values into a standard unit. Emilio opened a food truck last year where he sells burritos, and his business has stabilized over the last 4 months. Over that 4 month period, he has made $11,000 while working 625 hours. Emilio’s competition, Francis, has made $13,000 over the last 4 months while working 800 hours. Francis brags to Emilio that her business is more profitable. Is Francis’ claim warranted? Emilio’s average hourly earnings provide a useful statistic for evaluating how much his venture is, at least from a financial perspective, worth: \\[ \\frac{\\$11000}{625\\text{ hours}} = \\$17.60\\text{ per hour} \\] By knowing his average hourly wage, Emilio now has put his earnings into a standard unit that is easier to compare with many other jobs that he might consider. In comparison, Francis’ average hourly wage was \\[ \\frac{\\$13000}{800\\text{ hours}} = \\$16.25\\text{ per hour} \\] Thus, while Francis’ total earnings were larger than Emilio’s, when standardizing by hour, Francis shouldn’t brag. Suppose we want to compute the average income per person in the US. To do so, we might first think to take the mean of the per capita incomes across the 3,142 counties in the data set. What would be a better approach? The county data set is special in that each county actually represents many individual people. If we were to simply average across the income variable, we would be treating counties with 5,000 and 5,000,000 residents equally in the calculations. Instead, we should compute the total income for each county, add up all the counties’ totals, and then divide by the number of people in all the counties. If we completed these steps with the data, we would find that the per capita income for the US is $30,861. Had we computed the simple mean of per capita income across counties, the result would have been just $26,093! This example used what is called a weighted mean. For more information on this topic, check out the following online supplement regarding weighted means. 2.2.3 Histograms and shape Dot plots show the exact value for each observation. This is useful for small data sets, but they can become hard to read with larger samples. Rather than showing the value of each observation, we prefer to think of the value as belonging to a bin. For example, in the loan50 data set, we created a table of counts for the number of loans with interest rates between 5.0% and 7.5%, then the number of loans with rates between 7.5% and 10.0%, and so on. Observations that fall on the boundary of a bin (e.g., 10.00%) are allocated to the lower bin. This tabulation is shown in Table 2.3. These binned counts are plotted as bars in Figure 2.4 into what is called a histogram, which resembles a more heavily binned version of the stacked dot plot shown in Figure 2.3. Table 2.3: Counts for the binned interest_rate data. Interest rate 5% - 7.5% 7.5% - 10% 10% - 12.5% 12.5% - 15% 15% - 17.5% 17.5% - 20% 20% - 22.5% 22.5% - 25% 25% - 27.5% Count 11 15 8 4 5 4 1 1 1 Figure 2.4: A histogram of interest_rate. This distribution is strongly skewed to the right. Histograms provide a view of the data density. Higher bars represent where the data are relatively more common, or “dense.” For instance, there are many more loans with rates between 5% and 10% than loans with rates between 20% and 25% in the data set. The bars make it easy to see how the density of the data changes relative to the interest rate. Histograms are especially convenient for understanding the shape of the data distribution. Figure 2.4 suggests that most loans have rates under 15%, while only a handful of loans have rates above 20%. When data trail off to the right in this way and has a longer right tail, the shape is said to be right skewed27 Data sets with the reverse characteristic—a long, thinner tail to the left—are said to be left skewed. We also say that such a distribution has a long left tail. Data sets that show roughly equal trailing off in both directions are called symmetric. When data trail off in one direction, the distribution has a long tail. If a distribution has a long left tail, it is left skewed or negatively skewed. If a distribution has a long right tail, it is right skewed or positively skewed. Besides the mean (since it was labeled), what can you see in the dot plot in Figure 2.3 that you cannot see in the histogram in Figure 2.4?28 In addition to looking at whether a distribution is skewed or symmetric, histograms can be used to identify modes. A mode is represented by a prominent peak in the distribution. There is only one prominent peak in the histogram of interest_rate. A definition of mode sometimes taught in math classes is the value with the most occurrences in the data set. However, for many real-world data sets, it is common to have no observations with the same value in a data set, making this definition impractical in data analysis. Figure 2.5 shows histograms that have one, two, or three prominent peaks. Such distributions are called unimodal, bimodal, and multimodal, respectively. Any distribution with more than two prominent peaks is called multimodal. Notice that there was one prominent peak in the unimodal distribution with a second less prominent peak that was not counted since it only differs from its neighboring bins by a few observations. Figure 2.5: Counting only prominent peaks, the distributions are (left to right) unimodal, bimodal, and multimodal. Note that the left plot is unimodal because we are counting prominent peaks, not just any peak. Figure 2.4 reveals only one prominent mode in the interest rate. Is the distribution unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal?29 Height measurements of young students and adult teachers at a K-3 elementary school were taken. How many modes would you expect in this height data set?30. Looking for modes isn’t about finding a clear and correct answer about the number of modes in a distribution, which is why prominent is not rigorously defined in this book. The most important part of this examination is to better understand your data. Another type of plot that is helpful for exploring the shape of a distribution is a smoothed histogram, called a density plot. A density plot will scale the \\(y\\)-axis so that the total area under the density curve is equal to one. This allows us to get a sense of what proportion of the data lie in a certain interval, rather than the frequency of data in the interval. We can change the scale of a histogram to plot proportions rather than frequencies, then overlay a density curve on this rescaled histogram, as seen in Figure 2.6. Figure 2.6: A density plot of interest_rate overlayed on a histogram using density scale. 2.2.4 Variance and standard deviation The mean was introduced as a method to describe the center of a data set, and variability in the data is also important. Here, we introduce two measures of variability: the variance and the standard deviation. Both of these are very useful in data analysis, even though their formulas are a bit tedious to calculate by hand. The standard deviation is the easier of the two to comprehend, and it roughly describes how far away the typical observation is from the mean. We call the distance of an observation from its mean its deviation. Below are the deviations for the \\(1^{st}\\), \\(2^{nd}\\), \\(3^{rd}\\), and \\(50^{th}\\) observations in the interest_rate variable: \\[ x_1 - \\bar{x} = 10.9 - 11.57 = -0.67 \\] \\[ x_2 - \\bar{x} = 9.92 - 11.57 = -1.65 \\] \\[ x_3 - \\bar{x} = 26.3 - 11.57 = 14.73 \\] \\[ \\vdots \\] \\[ x_{50} - \\bar{x} = 6.08 - 11.57 = -5.49 \\] If we square these deviations and then take an average, the result is equal to the sample variance, denoted by \\(s^2\\): \\[ s^2 = \\frac{(-0.67)^2 + (-1.65)^2 + (14.73)^2 + \\cdots + (-5.49)^2}{50 - 1} = \\frac{0.45 + 2.72 + \\cdots + 30.14}{49} = 25.52 \\] We divide by \\(n - 1\\), rather than dividing by \\(n\\), when computing a sample’s variance; there’s some mathematical nuance here, but the end result is that doing this makes this statistic slightly more reliable and useful. Notice that squaring the deviations does two things. First, it makes large values relatively much larger. Second, it gets rid of any negative signs. The standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance: \\[ s = \\sqrt{25.52} = 5.05 \\] While often omitted, a subscript of \\(_x\\) may be added to the variance and standard deviation, i.e., \\(s_x^2\\) and \\(s_x\\), if it is useful as a reminder that these are the variance and standard deviation of the observations represented by \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), …, \\(x_n\\). Variance and standard deviation. The sample variance is the (near) average squared distance from the mean: \\[ s^2 = \\frac{((x_1 - \\bar{x})^2 + (x_2 - \\bar{x})^2 + \\cdots + (x_n - \\bar{x})^2)}{n-1} \\] The sample standard deviation is the square root of the variance: \\(s = \\sqrt{s^2}\\). The standard deviation is useful when considering how far the data are distributed from the mean. The standard deviation represents the typical deviation of observations from the mean. If the distribution is bell-shaped, about 70% of the data will be within one standard deviation of the mean and about 95% will be within two standard deviations. However, these percentages do not necessarily hold for other shaped distributions! Like the mean, the population values for variance and standard deviation have special symbols: \\(\\sigma^2\\) for the variance and \\(\\sigma\\) for the standard deviation. The Greek letter \\(\\sigma\\) is pronounced sigma, listen to the pronunciation here. Figure 2.7: For the interest_rate variable, 34 of the 50 loans (68%) had interest rates within 1 standard deviation of the mean, and 48 of the 50 loans (96%) had rates within 2 standard deviations. Usually about 70% of the data are within 1 standard deviation of the mean and 95% within 2 standard deviations, though this is far from a hard rule. Figure 2.8: Three very different population distributions with the same mean (0) and standard deviation (1). A good description of the shape of a distribution should include modality and whether the distribution is symmetric or skewed to one side. Using Figure 2.8 as an example, explain why such a description is important.31 Describe the distribution of the interest_rate variable using the histogram in Figure 2.4. The description should incorporate the center, variability, and shape of the distribution, and it should also be placed in context. Also note any especially unusual cases. The distribution of interest rates is unimodal and skewed to the high end. Many of the rates fall near the mean at 11.57%, and most fall within one standard deviation (5.05%) of the mean. There are a few exceptionally large interest rates in the sample that are above 20%. In practice, the variance and standard deviation are sometimes used as a means to an end, where the “end” is being able to accurately estimate the uncertainty associated with a sample statistic. For example, in Chapter ?? the standard deviation is used in calculations that help us understand how much a sample mean varies from one sample to the next. 2.2.5 Box plots, quartiles, and the median A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) summarizes a data set using five statistics while also identifying unusual observations. The five statistics—minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum—together are called the five number summary. Figure 2.9 provides a dot plot alongside a box plot of the interest_rate variable from the loan50 data set. Figure 2.9: Plot A shows a dot plot and Plot B shows a box plot of the distribution of interest rates from the loan50 dataset. The dark line inside the box represents the median, which splits the data in half: 50% of the data fall below this value and 50% fall above it. Since in the loan50 dataset there are 50 observations (an even number), the median is defined as the average of the two observations closest to the \\(50^{th}\\) percentile. Table @ref(tab:loan50_int_rate_sorted) shows all interest rates, arranged in ascending order. We can see that the \\(25^{th}\\) and the \\(26^{th}\\) values are both 9.93, which corresponds to the dark line in the box plot in Figure 2.9. (#tab:loan50_int_rate_sorted)Interest rates from the loan50 dataset, arranged in ascending order. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 5.31 5.31 5.32 6.08 6.08 6.08 6.71 6.71 7.34 7.35 10 7.35 7.96 7.96 7.96 7.97 9.43 9.43 9.44 9.44 9.44 20 9.92 9.92 9.92 9.92 9.93 9.93 10.42 10.42 10.90 10.90 30 10.91 10.91 10.91 11.98 12.62 12.62 12.62 14.08 15.04 16.02 40 17.09 17.09 17.09 18.06 18.45 19.42 20.00 21.45 24.85 26.30 When there are an odd number of observations, there will be exactly one observation that splits the data into two halves, and in such a case that observation is the median (no average needed). Median: the number in the middle. If the data are ordered from smallest to largest, the median is the observation right in the middle. If there are an even number of observations, there will be two values in the middle, and the median is taken as their average. Mathematically, if we denote the sample size by \\(n\\), then if \\(n\\) is odd, the median is the \\([(n+1)/2]^{th}\\) smallest value in the data set, and if \\(n\\) is even, the median is the average of the \\((n/2)^{th}\\) and \\((n/2+1)^{th}\\) smallest values in the data set. The second step in building a box plot is drawing a rectangle to represent the middle 50% of the data. The length of the the box is called the interquartile range, or IQR for short. It, like the standard deviation, is a measure of variability in data. The more variable the data, the larger the standard deviation and IQR tend to be. The two boundaries of the box are called the first quartile (the \\(25^{th}\\) percentile, i.e., 25% of the data fall below this value) and the third quartile (the \\(75^{th}\\) percentile, i.e., 75% of the data fall below this value) , and these are often labeled \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_3\\), respectively32 Interquartile range (IQR). The IQR interquartile range is the length of the box in a box plot. It is computed as \\[ IQR = Q_3 - Q_1, \\] where \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_3\\) are the \\(25^{th}\\) and \\(75^{th}\\) percentiles, respectively. What percent of the data fall between \\(Q_1\\) and the median? What percent is between the median and \\(Q_3\\)?33 Extending out from the box, the whiskers attempt to capture the data outside of the box. The whiskers of a box plot reach to the minimum and the maximum values in the data, unless there are points that are considered unusually high or unusually low, which are identified as potential outliers by the box plot. These are labeled with a dot on the box plot. The purpose of labeling these points—instead of extending the whiskers to the minimum and maximum observed values—is to help identify any observations that appear to be unusually distant from the rest of the data. There are a variety of formulas for determining whether a particular data point is considered an outlier, and different statistical software use different formulas. A commonly used formula is that any value that is beyond \\(1.5\\times IQR\\)[While the choice of exactly 1.5 is arbitrary, it is the most commonly used value for box plots.] away from the box is considered an outlier. In a sense, the box is like the body of the box plot and the whiskers are like its arms trying to reach the rest of the data, up to the outliers. In Figure 2.9, the upper whisker does not extend to the last two points, 24.85% and 26.3%, which are above \\(Q_3 + 1.5\\times IQR\\), and so it extends only to the last point below this limit. The lower whisker stops at the minimum value in the data set, 5.31%, since there are no outliers on the lower end of the distribution. The whiskers extend to actual data points—not the limits for outliers. That is, the values \\(Q_1 - 1.5\\times IQR\\) and \\(Q_3 + 1.5\\times IQR\\) should not be shown on the plot. Outliers are extreme. An outlier is an observation that appears extreme relative to the rest of the data. Examining data for outliers serves many useful purposes, including identifying strong skew in the distribution, identifying possible data collection or data entry errors, and providing insight into interesting properties of the data. Using the box plot in Figure 2.9, estimate the values of the \\(Q_1\\), \\(Q_3\\), and IQR for interest_rate in the loan50 data set.34 2.2.6 Describing and comparing quantitative distributions As a review, when describing a scatterplot—the association between two quantitative variables, we look for the four features: Form Direction Strength Outliers When asked to describe or compare univariate (single variable) quantitative distributions, we look for four features: Center Variability Shape Outliers We can compare quantitative distributions by using side-by-side box plots, or stacked histograms or dot plots. Recall that the loan50 data set represents a sample from a larger loan data set called loans. This larger data set contains information on 10,000 loans made through Lending Club. Figure @ examines the relationship between homeownership, which for the loans data can take a value of rent, mortgage (owns but has a mortgage), or own, and interest_rate. Note that homeownership is a categorical variable and interest_rate is a quantitative variable. Figure 2.10: Side-by-side box plots of loan interest rates by homeownership category. We see immediately that some features are easier to discern in box plots, while others in histograms. Shape is shown more clearly in histograms, while center (as measured by the median) is easy to compare across groups in the side-by-side box plots. Using Figure @ write a few sentences comparing the distributions of loan amount across the different homeownership categories. The median loan amount is higher for those with a mortgage (around $16,000) than for those who own or rent (around $12,000-$13,000). However, variability in loan amounts is similar across homeownership categories, with an IQR of around $15,000 and loans ranging from a few hundred dollars to $40,000. We see from the histograms that the distribution of loan amounts is skewed right for all three homeownership categories, which means the mean loan amount will be higher than the median loan amount. There are no apparent outliers in the mortgage category, but both the rent and own categories have outliers at $40,000. Besides center, variability, shape, and outliers, another interesting feature in these distributions is the result of rounding. Loan amounts in the data set are often rounded to the nearest 100, so we see spikes on these values in the histogram—something that is not evident in the box plots. 2.2.7 Robust statistics How are the sample statistics of the interest_rate data set affected by the observation, 26.3%? What would have happened if this loan had instead been only 15%? What would happen to these summary statistics if the observation at 26.3% had been even larger, say 35%? These scenarios are plotted alongside the original data in Figure 2.11, and sample statistics are computed under each scenario in Table 2.4. Figure 2.11: Dot plots of the original interest rate data and two modified data sets. Table 2.4: A comparison of how the median, IQR, mean, and standard deviation change as the value of an extereme observation from the original interest data changes. Robust Not robust Scenario Median IQR Mean SD Original data 9.93 5.75 11.6 5.05 Move 26.3% to 15% 9.93 5.75 11.3 4.61 Move 26.3% to 35% 9.93 5.75 11.7 5.68 Which is more affected by extreme observations, the mean or median? Is the standard deviation or IQR more affected by extreme observations?35 The median and IQR are called robust statistics because extreme observations have little effect on their values—moving the most extreme value generally has little influence on these statistics. On the other hand, the mean and standard deviation are more heavily influenced by changes in extreme observations, which can be important in some situations. Additionally, the mean tends to get pulled in the direction of a distribution’s skewness, while the skewness has little affect on the median. The median and IQR did not change under the three scenarios in Table 2.4. Why might this be the case? The median and IQR are only sensitive to numbers near \\(Q_1\\), the median, and \\(Q_3\\). Since values in these regions are stable in the three data sets, the median and IQR estimates are also stable. The distribution of loan amounts in the loan50 data set is right skewed, with a few large loans lingering out into the right tail. If you were wanting to understand the typical loan size, should you be more interested in the mean or median?36 2.2.8 Transforming data (special topic) When data are very strongly skewed, we sometimes transform them so they are easier to model. A transformation is a rescaling of the data using a function. Figure 2.12: Plot A: A histogram of the populations of all US counties. Plot B: A histogram of log\\(_{10}\\)-transformed county populations. For this plot, the x-value corresponds to the power of 10, e.g. 4 on the x-axis corresponds to \\(10^4 =\\) 10,000. Data are from 2017. Consider the histogram of county populations shown in the left of Figure @ref{fig:county-pop-transform}, which shows extreme skew. What is not so useful about this plot? Nearly all of the data fall into the left-most bin, and the extreme skew obscures many of the potentially interesting details in the data. There are some standard transformations that may be useful for strongly right skewed data where much of the data is positive but clustered near zero. For instance, a plot of the logarithm (base 10) of county populations results in the new histogram in Figure 2.12. This data is symmetric, and any potential outliers appear much less extreme than in the original data set. By reigning in the outliers and extreme skew, transformations like this often make it easier to build statistical models against the data. Transformations can also be applied to one or both variables in a scatterplot. A scatterplot of the population change from 2010 to 2017 against the population in 2010 is shown in Figure 2.13. In this first scatterplot, it’s hard to decipher any interesting patterns because the population variable is so strongly skewed. However, if we apply a log\\(_{10}\\) transformation to the population variable, as shown in Figure 2.13, a positive association between the variables is revealed. In fact, we may be interested in fitting a trend line to the data when we explore methods around fitting regression lines in Chapter 3. Figure 2.13: Plot A: Scatterplot of population change against the population before the change. Plot B: A~scatterplot of the same data but where the population size has been log-transformed. Transformations other than the logarithm can be useful, too. For instance, the square root (\\(\\sqrt{\\text{original observation}}\\)) and inverse (\\(\\frac{1}{\\text{original observation}}\\)) are commonly used by data scientists. Common goals in transforming data are to see the data structure differently, reduce skew, assist in modeling, or straighten a nonlinear relationship in a scatterplot. 2.2.9 Mapping data The county data set offers many numerical variables that we could plot using dot plots, scatterplots, or box plots, but these miss the true nature of the data. Rather, when we encounter geographic data, we should create an intensity map, where colors are used to show higher and lower values of a variable. Figures 2.14 and ?? show intensity maps for poverty rate in percent (poverty), unemployment rate (unemployment_rate), homeownership rate in percent (homeownership), and median household income (median_hh_income). The color key indicates which colors correspond to which values. The intensity maps are not generally very helpful for getting precise values in any given county, but they are very helpful for seeing geographic trends and generating interesting research questions or hypotheses. What interesting features are evident in the poverty and unemployment rate intensity maps? Poverty rates are evidently higher in a few locations. Notably, the deep south shows higher poverty rates, as does much of Arizona and New Mexico. High poverty rates are evident in the Mississippi flood plains a little north of New Orleans and also in a large section of Kentucky. The unemployment rate follows similar trends, and we can see correspondence between the two variables. In fact, it makes sense for higher rates of unemployment to be closely related to poverty rates. One observation that stands out when comparing the two maps: the poverty rate is much higher than the unemployment rate, meaning while many people may be working, they are not making enough to break out of poverty. What interesting features are evident in the median household income intensity map in Figure 2.15?37 Figure 2.14: Plot A: Intensity map of poverty rate (percent). Plot B: Intensity map of the unemployment rate (percent). Figure 2.15: Plot A: Intensity map of homeownership rate (percent). Plot B: Intensity map of median household income ($1000s). 2.3 R: Exploratory data analysis 2.4 Chapter 2 review We’re encountered a variety of univariate (one variable) and bivariate (two variable) data visualization methods in this chapter. Figure 2.16 presents a decision tree for deciding which type of plot is most appropriate for a given number and types of variables. In the next chapter, we’ll further explore how to model the association between two quantitative variables, called regression. In Chapter 4, we’ll look at exploratory data analysis methods for more than two variables.

While the equations and details change depending on the setting, the foundations for inference are the same throughout all of statistics. We will begin this chapter with a discussion of the foundations of inference, and introduce the two primary vehicles of inference: the hypothesis test and confidence interval. The rest of this chapter focuses statistical inference for categorical data. The two data structures we detail are: one binary variable, summarized using a single proportion, and two binary variables, summarized using a difference (or ratio) of two proportions. We will also introduce a new important mathematical model, the normal distribution (as the foundation for the \\(z\\)-test). Throughout the book so far, you have worked with data in a variety of contexts. You have learned how to summarize and visualize the data as well as how to model multiple variables at the same time. Sometimes the data set at hand represents the entire research question. But more often than not, the data have been collected to answer a research question about a larger group of which the data are a (hopefully) representative subset. You may agree that there is almost always variability in data (one data set will not be identical to a second data set even if they are both collected from the same population using the same methods). However, quantifying the variability in the data is neither obvious nor easy to do (how different is one data set from another?). Suppose your professor splits the students in class into two groups: students on the left and students on the right. If \\(\\hat{p}_{_L}\\) and \\(\\hat{p}_{_R}\\) represent the proportion of students who own an Apple product on the left and right, respectively, would you be surprised if \\(\\hat{p}_{_L}\\) did not exactly equal \\(\\hat{p}_{_R}\\)? While the proportions would probably be close to each other, it would be unusual for them to be exactly the same. We would probably observe a small difference due to chance. If we don’t think the side of the room a person sits on in class is related to whether the person owns an Apple product, what assumption are we making about the relationship between these two variables? (Reminder: for these Guided Practice questions, you can check your answer in the footnote.)38 Studying randomness of this form is a key focus of statistics. Throughout this chapter, and those that follow, we provide two different approaches for quantifying the variability inherent in data: simulation-based methods and theory-based methods (mathematical models). Using the methods provided in this and future chapters, we will be able to draw conclusions beyond the data set at hand to research questions about larger populations. 5.1 Foundations of inference Given results seen in a sample, the process of determining what we can infer to the population based on sample results is called statistical inference. Statistical inferential methods enable us to understand and quantify the uncertainty of our sample results. Statistical inference helps us answer two questions about the population: How strong is the evidence of an effect? How large is the effect? The first question is answered through a hypothesis test, while the second is addressed with a confidence interval. 5.1.1 Motivating example: Martian alphabet How well can humans distinguish one “Martian” letter from another? The Figure 5.1 displays two Martian letters—one is Kiki and the another is Bumba. Which do you think is Kiki and which do you think is Bumba?39 Figure 5.1: Two Martian letters: Bumba and Kiki. Do you think the letter Bumba is on the left or the right?40 This same image and question were presented to an introductory statistics class of 38 students. In that class, 34 students correctly identified Bumba as the Martian letter on the left. Assuming we can’t read Martian, is this result surprising? One of two possibilities occurred: We can’t read Martian, and these results just occurred by chance. We can read Martian, and these results reflect this ability. To decide between these two possibilities, we could calculate the probability of observing such results in a randomly selected sample of 38 students, under the assumption that students were just guessing. If this probability is very low, we’d have reason to reject the first possibility in favor of the second. We can calculate this probability using one of two methods: Simulation-based method: simulate lots of samples (Classes) of 38 students under the assumption that students are just guessing, then calculate the proportion of these simulated samples where we saw 34 or more students guessing correctly, or Theory-based method: develop a mathematical model for the sample proportion in this scenario and use the model to calculate the probability. How could you use a coin or cards to simulate the guesses of one sample of 38 students who cannot read Martian?41 For this situation—since “just guessing” means you have a 50% chance of guessing correctly—we could simulate a sample of 38 students’ guesses by flipping a coin 38 times and counting the number of times it lands on heads. Using a computer to repeat this process 1,000 times, we create the dot plot in Figure 5.2. Figure 5.2: A dot plot of 1,000 sample proportions; each calculated by flipping a coin 38 times and calculating the proportion of times the coin landed on heads. None of the 1,000 simulations had sample proportion of at least 89%, which was the proportion observed in the study. None of our simulated samples produce 34 of 38 correct guesses! That is, if students were just guessing, it is nearly impossible to observe 34 or more correct guesses in a sample of 38 students. Given this low probability, the more plausible possibility is 2. We can read Martian, and these results reflect this ability. We’ve just completed our first hypothesis test! Now, obviously no one can read Martian, so a more realistic possibility is that humans tend to choose Bumba on the left more often than the right—there is a greater than 50% chance of choosing Bumba as the letter on the left. Even though we may think we’re guessing just by chance, we have a preference for Bumba on the left. It turns out that the explanation for this preference is called synesthesia, a tendency for humans to correlate sharp sounding noises (e.g., Kiki) with sharp looking images.42 But wait—we’re not done! We have evidence that humans tend to prefer Bumba on the left, but by how much? To answer this, we need a confidence interval—an interval of plausible values for the true probability humans will selecting Bumba as the left letter. The width of this interval is determined by how variable sample proportions are from sample to sample. It turns out, there is a mathematical model for this variability that we will explore later in this chapter. For now, let’s take the standard deviation from our simulated sample proportions as an estimate for this variability: 0.08. Since the simulated distribution of proportions is bell-shaped, we know about 95% of sample proportions should fall within two standard deviations of the true proportion, so we can add and subtract this margin of error to our sample proportion to calculate an approximate 95% confidence interval43: \\[ \\frac{34}{38} \\pm 2\\times 0.08 = 0.89 \\pm 0.16 = (0.73, 1) \\] Thus, based on this data, we are 95% confident that the probability a human guesses Bumba on the left is somewhere between 73% and 100%. 5.1.2 Variability in a statistic There are two approaches to modeling how a statistic may vary from sample to sample. In the Martian alphabet example, we used a simulation-based approach to model this variability, using the standard deviation of the simulated distribution of sample proportions as a quantitative measure of this sampling variability. Simulation-based methods include the randomization tests and bootstrapping methods we will use in this textbook. We can also use a theory-based approach—one which makes use of mathematical modeling—and involves the normal and \\(t\\) probability distributions. All of the theory-based methods discussed in this book work (under certain conditions) because of a very important theorem in Statistics called the Central Limit Theorem. Central Limit Theorem. For large sample sizes, the sampling distribution of a sample proportion (or sample mean) will appear to follow a bell-shaped curve called the normal distribution. An example of a perfect normal distribution is shown in Figure 5.3. While the mean (center) and standard deviation (variability) may change for different scenarios, the general shape remains roughly intact. Figure 5.3: A normal curve. Recall from Chapter 2 that a distribution of a variable is a description of the possible values it takes and how frequently each value occurs. In a sampling distribution, our “variable” is a sample statistic, and the sampling distribution is a description of the possible values a sample statistic takes and how frequently each value occurs when looking across many many possible samples. It is quite amazing that something like a sample proportion, summarizing a categorical variable, will have a bell-shaped sampling distribution if we sample large enough samples! Theory-based methods also give us mathematical expressions for the standard deviation of a sampling distribution. For instance, if the true population proportion is \\(\\pi\\), then the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample proportions is \\[ SD(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi(1-\\pi)}{n}}. \\] In the case of two samples, a sample of size \\(n_1\\) taken from a population with proportion \\(\\pi_1\\), and the other of size \\(n_2\\) from a population with proportion \\(\\pi_2\\), the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the difference in sample proportions is \\[ SD(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi_1(1-\\pi_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{\\pi_2(1-\\pi_2)}{n}} \\] Typically, the values of the parameters \\(\\pi\\), \\(\\pi_1\\), and \\(\\pi_2\\) are unknown, so we are unable to calculate these standard deviations. In this case, we substitute our “best guess” for \\(\\pi\\) in the formulas, either from a hypothesis or from a point estimate. Standard error. The standard deviation of a sampling distribution for a statistic represents how far away we would expect the statistic to land from the parameter. Since the formulas for these standard deviations depend on unknown parameters, we substitute our “best guess” for \\(\\pi\\) in the formulas, either from a hypothesis or from a point estimate. The resulting estimated standard deviation is called the standard error of the statistic. 5.1.3 Hypothesis tests In the Martian alphabet example, we utilized a hypothesis test, which is a formal technique for evaluating two competing possibilities. Each hypothesis test involves a null hypothesis, which represents either a skeptical perspective or a perspective of no difference or no effect, and an alternative hypothesis, which represents a new perspective such as the possibility that there has been a change or that there is a treatment effect in an experiment. The alternative hypothesis is usually the reason the scientists set out to do the research in the first place. Null and alternative hypotheses. The null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) often represents either a skeptical perspective or a claim to be tested. The alternative hypothesis (\\(H_A\\)) represents an alternative claim under consideration and is often represented by a range of possible values for the parameter of interest. In the Martian alphabet example, which of the two competing possibilities was the null hypothesis? the alternative hypothesis?44 The hypothesis testing framework is a very general tool, and we often use it without a second thought. If a person makes a somewhat unbelievable claim, we are initially skeptical. However, if there is sufficient evidence that supports the claim, we set aside our skepticism. The hallmarks of hypothesis testing are also found in the US court system. The US court system A US court considers two possible claims about a defendant: they are either innocent or guilty. If we set these claims up in a hypothesis framework, which would be the null hypothesis and which the alternative? The jury considers whether the evidence is so convincing (strong) that there is no reasonable doubt regarding the person’s guilt. That is, the skeptical perspective (null hypothesis) is that the person is innocent until evidence is presented that convinces the jury that the person is guilty (alternative hypothesis). Analogously, in a hypothesis test, we assume the null hypothesis until evidence is presented that convinces us the alternative hypothesis is true. Jurors examine the evidence to see whether it convincingly shows a defendant is guilty. Notice that if a jury finds a defendant not guilty, this does not necessarily mean the jury is confident in the person’s innocence. They are simply not convinced of the alternative that the person is guilty. This is also the case with hypothesis testing: even if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we typically do not accept the null hypothesis as truth. Failing to find strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis is not equivalent to providing evidence that the null hypothesis is true. p-value In the Martian alphabet example, we performed a simulation-based hypothesis test of the hypotheses: \\(H_0\\): The chance a human chooses Bumba on the left is 50%. \\(H_A\\): Humans have a preference for choosing Bumba on the left. The research question—can humans read Martian?—was framed in the context of these hypotheses. The null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) was a perspective of no effect (no ability to read Martian). The student data provided a point estimate of 89.5% (\\(34/38 \\times 100\\)%) for the true probability of choosing Bumba on the left. We determined that observing such a sample proportion from chance alone (assuming \\(H_0\\)) would be rare—it would only happen in less than 1 out of 1000 samples. When results like these are inconsistent with \\(H_0\\), we reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_A\\). Here, we concluded there humans have a preference for choosing Bumba on the left. The less than 1-in-1000 chance is what we call a p-value, which is a probability quantifying the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis and in favor of the alternative. p-value. The p-value is the probability of observing data at least as favorable to the alternative hypothesis as our current data set, if the null hypothesis were true. We typically use a summary statistic of the data, such as a proportion or difference in proportions, to help compute the p-value and evaluate the hypotheses. This summary value that is used to compute the p-value is often called the test statistic. When interpreting a p-value, remember that the definition of a p-value has three components. It is a (1) probability. What it is the probability of? It is the probability of (2) our observed sample statistic or one more extreme. Assuming what? It is the probability of our observed sample statistic or one more extreme, (3) assuming the null hypothesis is true: probability data45 null hypothesis What was the test statistic in the Martian alphabet example? The test statistic in the the Martian alphabet example was the sample proportion, \\(\\frac{34}{38} = 0.895\\) (or 89.5%). This is also the point estimate of the true probability that humans would choose Bumba on the left. Since the p-value is a probability, its value will always be between 0 and 1. The closer the p-value is to 0, the stronger the evidence we have against the null hypothesis. Why? A small p-value means that our data are unlikely to occur, if the null hypothesis is true. We take that to mean that the null hypothesis isn’t a plausible assumption, and we reject it. This process mimics the scientific method—it is easier to disprove a theory than prove it. If scientists want to find evidence that a new drug reduces the risk of stroke, then they assume it doesn’t reduce the risk of stroke and then show that the observed data are so unlikely to occur that the more plausible explanation is that the drug works. Think of the p-value as a continuum of strength of evidence against the null. You may use Table 5.1 as a general guide, but remember that there are no hard and fast cutoffs on this scale—the strength of evidence against the null with a p-value of 0.049 is the same as with a p-value of 0.051. Table 5.1: The p-value as a continuum of strength of evidence against the null–a general guide. p-value range Strength of evidence against \\(H_0\\) p-value &lt; 0.01 very strong 0.01 &lt; p-value &lt; 0.05 strong 0.05 &lt; p-value &lt; 0.10 moderate p-value &gt; 0.10 little to no evidence Regardless of the data structure or analysis method, the hypothesis testing framework always follows the same steps—only the details for how we model randomness in the data change. Steps of a hypothesis test. Every hypothesis test follows these same general steps: Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses. Collect and summarize data using a test statistic. Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic. Compare the observed test statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value. Make a conclusion based on the p-value, and write a conclusion in context, in plain language, and in terms of the alternative hypothesis. Decisions and statistical significance In some cases, a decision to the hypothesis test is needed, with the two possible decisions as follows: Reject the null hypothesis Fail to reject the null hypothesis For which values of the p-value should you “reject” a null hypothesis? “fail to reject” a null hypothesis?46 In order to decide between these two options, we need a previously set threshold for our p-value: when the p-value is less than a previously set threshold, we reject \\(H_0\\); otherwise, we fail to reject \\(H_0\\). This threshold is called the significance level, and when the p-value is less than the significance level, we say the results are statistically significant. This means the data provide such strong evidence against \\(H_0\\) that we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. The significance level, often represented by \\(\\alpha\\) (the Greek letter alpha), is typically set to \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), but can vary depending on the field or the application and the real-life consequences of an incorrect decision. Using a significance level of \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) in the Martian alphabet study, we can say that the data provided statistically significant evidence against the null hypothesis. Statistical significance. We say that the data provide statistically significant evidence against the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than some reference value called the significance level, denoted by \\(\\alpha\\). What’s so special about 0.05? We often use a threshold of 0.05 to determine whether a result is statistically significant. But why 0.05? Maybe we should use a bigger number, or maybe a smaller number. If you’re a little puzzled, that probably means you’re reading with a critical eye—good job! The OpenIntro authors have a video to help clarify why 0.05: https://www.openintro.org/book/stat/why05/ Sometimes it’s also a good idea to deviate from the standard. We’ll discuss when to choose a threshold different than 0.05 in Section ??. Statistical significance has been a hot topic in the news, related to the “reproducibility crisis” in some scientific fields. We encourage you to read more about the debate on the use of p-values and statistical significance. A good place to start would be the Nature article, “Scientists rise up against statistical significance,” from March 20, 2019. 5.1.4 Confidence intervals A point estimate provides a single plausible value for a parameter. However, a point estimate is rarely perfect—usually there is some error in the estimate. In addition to supplying a point estimate of a parameter, a next logical step would be to provide a plausible range of values for the parameter. A plausible range of values for the population parameter is called a confidence interval. Using only a single point estimate is like fishing in a murky lake with a spear, and using a confidence interval is like fishing with a net. We can throw a spear where we saw a fish, but we will probably miss. On the other hand, if we toss a net in that area, we have a good chance of catching the fish. If we report a point estimate, we probably will not hit the exact population parameter. On the other hand, if we report a range of plausible values—a confidence interval—we have a good shot at capturing the parameter. This reasoning also explains why we can never prove a null hypothesis. Sample statistics will vary from sample to sample. While we can quantify this uncertainty (e.g., we are 95% sure the statistic is within 0.15 of the parameter), we can never be certain that the parameter is an exact value. For example, suppose want to test whether a coin is a fair coin, i.e., \\(H_0: \\pi = 0.50\\) versus \\(H_0: \\pi \\neq 0.50\\), so you toss the coin 10 times to collect data. In those 10 tosses, 6 land on heads and 4 land on tails, resulting in a p-value of 0.75447. We don’t have enough evidence to show that the coin is biased, but surely we wouldn’t say we just proved the coin is fair! There are only two possible decisions in a hypothesis test: (1) reject \\(H_0\\), or (2) fail to reject \\(H_0\\). Since one can never prove a null hypothesis—we can only disprove48 it—we never have the ability to “accept the null.” You may have seen this phrase in other textbooks or articles, but it is incorrect. If we want to be very certain we capture the population parameter, should we use a wider interval or a smaller interval?49 In Section 5.3.2.1 we will discuss different percentages for the confidence interval (e.g., 90% confidence interval or 99% confidence interval). Section ?? also provides a longer discussion on what “95% confidence” actually means. 5.2 The normal distribution Among all the distributions we see in statistics, one is overwhelmingly the most common. The symmetric, unimodal, bell curve is ubiquitous throughout statistics. It is so common that people know it as a variety of names including the normal curve, normal model, or normal distribution.50 Under certain conditions, sample proportions, sample means, and sample differences can be modeled using the normal distribution—the basis for our theory-based inference methods. Additionally, some variables such as SAT scores and heights of US adult males closely follow the normal distribution. Normal distribution facts. Many summary statistics and variables are nearly normal, but none are exactly normal. Thus the normal distribution, while not perfect for any single problem, is very useful for a variety of problems. We will use it in data exploration and to solve important problems in statistics. In this section, we will discuss the normal distribution in the context of data to become more familiar with normal distribution techniques. 5.2.1 Normal distribution model The normal distribution always describes a symmetric, unimodal, bell-shaped curve. However, normal curves can look different depending on the details of the model. Specifically, the normal model can be adjusted using two parameters: mean and standard deviation. As you can probably guess, changing the mean shifts the bell curve to the left or right, while changing the standard deviation stretches or constricts the curve. Figure 5.4 shows the normal distribution with mean \\(0\\) and standard deviation \\(1\\) (which is commonly referred to as the standard normal distribution) on top. A normal distribution with mean \\(19\\) and standard deviation \\(4\\) is shown on the bottom. Figure 5.5 shows the same two normal distributions on the same axis. Figure 5.4: Both curves represent the normal distribution, however, they differ in their center and spread. The normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 is called the standard normal distribution. Figure 5.5: The two normal models shown above and now plotted together on the same scale. If a normal distribution has mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), we may write the distribution as \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma)\\). The two distributions in Figure 5.5 can be written as \\[\\begin{align*} N(\\mu=0,\\sigma=1)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad N(\\mu=19,\\sigma=4) \\end{align*}\\] Because the mean and standard deviation describe a normal distribution exactly, they are called the distribution’s parameters. Write down the short-hand for a normal distribution with (a) mean 5 and standard deviation 3, (b) mean -100 and standard deviation 10, and (c) mean 2 and standard deviation 9.51 5.2.2 Standardizing with Z-scores Table 5.2 shows the mean and standard deviation for total scores on the SAT and ACT. The distribution of SAT and ACT scores are both nearly normal. Suppose Ann scored 1800 on her SAT and Tom scored 24 on his ACT. Who performed better?52 Table 5.2: Mean and standard deviation for the SAT and ACT. SAT ACT Mean 1500 21 SD 300 5 Figure 5.6: Ann’s and Tom’s scores shown with the distributions of SAT and ACT scores. The solution to the previous example relies on a standardization technique called a Z-score, a method most commonly employed for nearly normal observations (but that may be used with any distribution). The Z-score of an observation is defined as the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean. If the observation is one standard deviation above the mean, its Z-score is 1. If it is 1.5 standard deviations below the mean, then its Z-score is -1.5. If \\(x\\) is an observation from a distribution \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma)\\), we define the Z-score mathematically as \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} Z = \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Using \\(\\mu_{SAT}=1500\\), \\(\\sigma_{SAT}=300\\), and \\(x_{Ann}=1800\\), we find Ann’s Z-score: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} Z_{Ann} = \\frac{x_{Ann} - \\mu_{SAT}}{\\sigma_{SAT}} = \\frac{1800-1500}{300} = 1 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The Z-score. The Z-score of an observation is the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean. We compute the Z-score for an observation \\(x\\) that follows a distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) by first subtracting its mean, then dividing by its standard deviation: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} Z = \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Use Tom’s ACT score, 24, along with the ACT mean and standard deviation to compute his Z-score.53 Observations above the mean always have positive Z-scores while those below the mean have negative Z-scores. If an observation is equal to the mean (e.g., SAT score of 1500), then the Z-score is \\(0\\). Let \\(X\\) represent a random variable from \\(N(\\mu=3, \\sigma=2)\\), and suppose we observe \\(x=5.19\\). (a) Find the Z-score of \\(x\\). (b) Use the Z-score to determine how many standard deviations above or below the mean \\(x\\) falls.54 Head lengths of brushtail possums follow a nearly normal distribution with mean 92.6 mm and standard deviation 3.6 mm. Compute the Z-scores for possums with head lengths of 95.4 mm and 85.8 mm.55 We can use Z-scores to roughly identify which observations are more unusual than others. One observation \\(x_1\\) is said to be more unusual than another observation \\(x_2\\) if the absolute value of its Z-score is larger than the absolute value of the other observation’s Z-score: \\(|Z_1| &gt; |Z_2|\\). This technique is especially insightful when a distribution is symmetric. Which of the two brushtail possum observations in the previous guided practice is more unusual?56 5.2.3 Normal probability calculations in R Ann from the SAT Guided Practice earned a score of 1800 on her SAT with a corresponding \\(Z=1\\). She would like to know what percentile she falls in among all SAT test-takers. Ann’s percentile is the percentage of people who earned a lower SAT score than Ann. We shade the area representing those individuals in Figure 5.7. The total area under the normal curve is always equal to 1, and the proportion of people who scored below Ann on the SAT is equal to the area shaded in Figure 5.7: 0.8413. In other words, Ann is in the \\(84^{th}\\) percentile of SAT takers. Figure 5.7: The normal model for SAT scores, shading the area of those individuals who scored below Ann. We can use the normal model to find percentiles or probabilities. In R, the function to calculate normal probabilities is pnorm. The normTail function is available in the openintro R package and will draw the associated curve if it is helpful. In the code below, we find the percentile of \\(Z=0.43\\) is 0.6664, or the \\(66.64^{th}\\) percentile. pnorm(0.43, m = 0, s = 1) #&gt; [1] 0.666 openintro::normTail(0.43, m = 0, s = 1) We can also find the Z-score associated with a percentile. For example, to identify Z for the \\(80^{th}\\) percentile, we use qnorm which identifies the quantile for a given percentage. The quantile represents the cutoff value. (To remember the function qnorm as providing a cutoff, notice that both qnorm and “cutoff” start with the sound “kuh”. To remember the pnorm function as providing a probability from a given cutoff, notice that both pnorm and probability start with the sound “puh”.) We determine the Z-score for the \\(80^{th}\\) percentile using qnorm: 0.84. qnorm(0.80, m = 0, s = 1) #&gt; [1] 0.842 openintro::normTail(0.80, m = 0, s = 1) We can use these functions with other normal distributions than the standard normal distribution by specifying the mean as the argument for m and the standard deviation as the argument for s. Here we determine the proportion of ACT test takers who scored worse than Tom on the ACT: 0.73. pnorm(24, m = 21, s = 5) #&gt; [1] 0.726 openintro::normTail(24, m = 21, s = 5) Determine the proportion of SAT test takers who scored better than Ann on the SAT.57 5.2.4 Normal probability examples Cumulative SAT scores are approximated well by a normal model, \\(N(\\mu=1500, \\sigma=300)\\). Shannon is a randomly selected SAT taker, and nothing is known about Shannon’s SAT aptitude. What is the probability that Shannon scores at least 1630 on her SATs? First, always draw and label a picture of the normal distribution. (Drawings need not be exact to be useful.) We are interested in the chance she scores above 1630, so we shade the upper tail. See the normal curve below. The picture shows the mean and the values at 2 standard deviations above and below the mean. The simplest way to find the shaded area under the curve makes use of the Z-score of the cutoff value. With \\(\\mu=1500\\), \\(\\sigma=300\\), and the cutoff value \\(x=1630\\), the Z-score is computed as \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} Z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{1630 - 1500}{300} = \\frac{130}{300} = 0.43 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] We use software to find the percentile of \\(Z=0.43\\), which yields 0.6664. However, the percentile describes those who had a Z-score lower than 0.43. To find the area above \\(Z=0.43\\), we compute one minus the area of the lower tail, as seen below. The probability Shannon scores at least 1630 on the SAT is 0.3336. Always draw a picture first, and find the Z-score second. For any normal probability situation, always always always draw and label the normal curve and shade the area of interest first. The picture will provide an estimate of the probability. After drawing a figure to represent the situation, identify the Z-score for the observation of interest. If the probability of Shannon scoring at least 1630 is 0.3336, then what is the probability she scores less than 1630? Draw the normal curve representing this exercise, shading the lower region instead of the upper one.58 Edward earned a 1400 on his SAT. What is his percentile? First, a picture is needed. Edward’s percentile is the proportion of people who do not get as high as a 1400. These are the scores to the left of 1400. Identifying the mean \\(\\mu=1500\\), the standard deviation \\(\\sigma=300\\), and the cutoff for the tail area \\(x=1400\\) makes it easy to compute the Z-score: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} Z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{1400 - 1500}{300} = -0.33 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Using the normal probability table, identify the row of \\(-0.3\\) and column of \\(0.03\\), which corresponds to the probability \\(0.3707\\). Edward is at the \\(37^{th}\\) percentile. Use the results of the previous example to compute the proportion of SAT takers who did better than Edward. Also draw a new picture.59 Areas to the right. The normal probability table in most books gives the area to the left. If you would like the area to the right, first find the area to the left and then subtract this amount from one. Stuart earned an SAT score of 2100. Draw a picture for each part. (a) What is his percentile? (b) What percent of SAT takers did better than Stuart?60 Based on a sample of 100 men,61 the heights of male adults between the ages 20 and 62 in the US is nearly normal with mean 70.0’’ and standard deviation 3.3’’. Mike is 5’7’’ and Jim is 6’4’’. (a) What is Mike’s height percentile? (b) What is Jim’s height percentile? Also draw one picture for each part.62 The last several problems have focused on finding the probability or percentile for a particular observation. What if you would like to know the observation corresponding to a particular percentile? Erik’s height is at the \\(40^{th}\\) percentile. How tall is he? As always, first draw the picture (see below). In this case, the lower tail probability is known (0.40), which can be shaded on the diagram. We want to find the observation that corresponds to this value. As a first step in this direction, we determine the Z-score associated with the \\(40^{th}\\) percentile. Because the percentile is below 50%, we know \\(Z\\) will be negative. Looking in the negative part of the normal probability table, we search for the probability inside the table closest to 0.4000. We find that 0.4000 falls in row \\(-0.2\\) and between columns \\(0.05\\) and \\(0.06\\). Since it falls closer to \\(0.05\\), we take this one: \\(Z=-0.25\\). Knowing \\(Z_{Erik}=-0.25\\) and the population parameters \\(\\mu=70\\) and \\(\\sigma=3.3\\) inches, the Z-score formula can be set up to determine Erik’s unknown height, labeled \\(x_{Erik}\\): \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} -0.25 = Z_{Erik} = \\frac{x_{Erik} - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{x_{Erik} - 70}{3.3} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Solving for \\(x_{Erik}\\) yields the height 69.18 inches. That is, Erik is about 5’9’’ (this is notation for 5-feet, 9-inches). qnorm(0.4, m = 0, s = 1) #&gt; [1] -0.253 What is the adult male height at the \\(82^{nd}\\) percentile? Again, we draw the figure first (see below). Next, we want to find the Z-score at the \\(82^{nd}\\) percentile, which will be a positive value. Using qnorm(), the \\(82^{nd}\\) percentile corresponds to \\(Z=0.92\\). Finally, the height \\(x\\) is found using the Z-score formula with the known mean \\(\\mu\\), standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), and Z-score \\(Z=0.92\\): \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} 0.92 = Z = \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{x - 70}{3.3} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] This yields 73.04 inches or about 6’1’’ as the height at the \\(82^{nd}\\) percentile. qnorm(0.82, m = 0, s = 1) #&gt; [1] 0.915 What is the \\(95^{th}\\) percentile for SAT scores? What is the \\(97.5^{th}\\) percentile of the male heights? As always with normal probability problems, first draw a picture.63 What is the probability that a randomly selected male adult is at least 6’2’’ (74 inches)? What is the probability that a male adult is shorter than 5’9’’ (69 inches)?64 What is the probability that a random adult male is between 5’9’’ and 6’2’’? These heights correspond to 69 inches and 74 inches. First, draw the figure. The area of interest is no longer an upper or lower tail. The total area under the curve is 1. If we find the area of the two tails that are not shaded (from the previous Guided Practice, these areas are \\(0.3821\\) and \\(0.1131\\)), then we can find the middle area: That is, the probability of being between 5’9’’ and 6’2’’ is 0.5048. What percent of SAT takers get between 1500 and 2000?65 What percent of adult males are between 5’5’’ and 5’7’’?66 5.2.5 68-95-99.7 rule Here, we present a useful general rule for the probability of falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution. The rule will be useful in a wide range of practical settings, especially when trying to make a quick estimate without a calculator or Z table. Figure 5.8: Probabilities for falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution. Use pnorm to confirm that about 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of observations fall within 1, 2, and 3, standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution, respectively. For instance, first find the area that falls between \\(Z=-1\\) and \\(Z=1\\), which should have an area of about 0.68. Similarly there should be an area of about 0.95 between \\(Z=-2\\) and \\(Z=2\\).67 It is possible for a normal random variable to fall 4, 5, or even more standard deviations from the mean. However, these occurrences are very rare if the data are nearly normal. The probability of being further than 4 standard deviations from the mean is about 1-in-30,000. For 5 and 6 standard deviations, it is about 1-in-3.5 million and 1-in-1 billion, respectively. SAT scores closely follow the normal model with mean \\(\\mu = 1500\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 300\\). (a) About what percent of test takers score 900 to 2100? (b) What percent score between 1500 and 2100?68 5.3 One proportion Notation. \\(n\\) = sample size (number of observational units in the data set) \\(\\hat{p}\\) = sample proportion (number of “successes” divided by the sample size) \\(\\pi\\) = population proportion69 A single proportion is used to summarize data when we measured a single categorical variable on each observational unit—the single variable is measured as either a success or failure (e.g., “surgical complication” vs. “no surgical complication”)70. 5.3.1 Hypothesis test for \\(H_0: \\pi = \\pi_0\\) Regardless of if we use simulation-based methods or theory-based methods, the first few steps of a hypothesis test start out the same: Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses. Collect and summarize data using a test statistic. People providing an organ for donation sometimes seek the help of a special medical consultant. These consultants assist the patient in all aspects of the surgery, with the goal of reducing the possibility of complications during the medical procedure and recovery. Patients might choose a consultant based in part on the historical complication rate of the consultant’s clients. One consultant tried to attract patients by noting the average complication rate for liver donor surgeries in the US is about 10%, but her clients have had only 3 complications in the 62 liver donor surgeries she has facilitated. She claims this is strong evidence that her work meaningfully contributes to reducing complications (and therefore she should be hired!). Using these data, is it possible to assess the consultant’s claim that her work meaningfully contributes to reducing complications? No. The claim is that there is a causal connection, but the data are observational, so we must be on the lookout for confounding variables. For example, maybe patients who can afford a medical consultant can afford better medical care, which can also lead to a lower complication rate. While it is not possible to assess the causal claim, it is still possible to understand the consultant’s true rate of complications. We will let \\(\\pi\\) represent the true complication rate for liver donors working with this consultant. This “true” complication probability is called the parameter of interest71.) The sample proportion for the complication rate is 3 complications divided by the 62 surgeries the consultant has worked on: \\(\\hat{p} = 3/62 = 0.048\\). Since this value is estimated from sample data, it is called a statistic. The statistic \\(\\hat{p}\\) is our point estimate, or “best guess,” for \\(\\pi\\). Parameters and statistics. A parameter is the “true” value of interest. We typically estimate the parameter using a statistic or point estimate from a sample of data. For example, we estimate the probability \\(\\pi\\) of a complication for a client of the medical consultant by examining the past complications rates of her clients: \\[\\hat{p} = 3 / 62 = 0.048\\qquad\\text{is used to estimate}\\qquad \\pi\\] Summary measures that summarize a sample of data, such as \\(\\hat{p}\\), are called statistics. Numbers that summarize an entire population, such as \\(\\pi\\), are called parameters. You can remember this distinction by looking at the first letter of each term: Statistics summarize Samples; Parameters summarize Populations. We typically use Roman letters to symbolize statistics (e.g., \\(\\bar{x}\\), \\(\\hat{p}\\)), and Greek letters to symbolize parameters (e.g., \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\pi\\)). Since we rarely can measure the entire population, and thus rarely know the actual parameter values, we like to say, “We don’t know Greek, and we don’t know parameters!” Write out hypotheses in both plain and statistical language to test for the association between the consultant’s work and the true complication rate, \\(\\pi\\), for the consultant’s clients. In words: \\(H_0\\): There is no association between the consultant’s contributions and the clients’ complication rate. \\(H_A\\): Patients who work with the consultant tend to have a complication rate lower than 10%. In statistical language In statistical language: \\(H_0: \\pi=0.10\\) \\(H_A: \\pi&lt;0.10\\) To assess these hypotheses, we need to evaluate the possibility of a sample value (\\(\\hat{p}\\)) as far below the null value, \\(\\pi_0=0.10\\) as what was observed. Null value of a hypothesis test. The null value is the reference value for the parameter in \\(H_0\\), and it is sometimes represented with the parameter’s label with a subscript 0 (or “null”), e.g., \\(\\pi_0\\) (just like \\(H_0\\)). The deviation of the sample statistic from the null hypothesized parameter is usually quantified with a p-value. The p-value is computed based on the null distribution, which is the distribution of the test statistic if the null hypothesis is true. Supposing the null hypothesis is true, we can compute the p-value by identifying the chance of observing a test statistic that favors the alternative hypothesis at least as strongly as the observed test statistic. The null distribution can be created through simulation (simulation-based methods), or can be modeled by a mathematical function (theory-based methods). Simulation-based method for calculating the p-value We want to identify the sampling distribution of the test statistic (\\(\\hat{p}\\)) if the null hypothesis was true. In other words, we want to see how the sample proportion changes due to chance alone. Then we plan to use this information to decide whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Under the null hypothesis, 10% of liver donors have complications during or after surgery. Suppose this rate was really no different for the consultant’s clients (for all the consultant’s clients, not just the 62 previously measured). If this was the case, we could simulate 62 clients to get a sample proportion for the complication rate from the null distribution. This is a similar scenario to the one we encountered in Section 5.1.1, with one important difference—the null value is 0.10, not 0.50. Thus, a flipping a coin to simulate whether a client had complications would not be simulating under the correct null hypothesis. What physical object could you use to simulate a random sample of 62 clients who had a 10% chance of complications? How would you use this object?72 Assuming the true complication rate for the consultant’s clients is 10%, each client can be simulated using a bag of marbles with 10% red marbles and 90% white marbles. Sampling a marble from the bag (with 10% red marbles) is one way of simulating whether a patient has a complication if the true complication rate is 10% for the data. If we select 62 marbles and then compute the proportion of patients with complications in the simulation, \\(\\hat{p}_{sim}\\), then the resulting sample proportion is calculated exactly from a sample from the null distribution. An undergraduate student was paid $2 to complete this simulation. There were 5 simulated cases with a complication and 57 simulated cases without a complication, i.e., \\(\\hat{p}_{sim} = 5/62 = 0.081\\). Is this one simulation enough to determine whether or not we should reject the null hypothesis? No. To assess the hypotheses, we need to see a distribution of many \\(\\hat{p}_{sim}\\), not just a single draw from this sampling distribution. One simulation isn’t enough to get a sense of the null distribution; many simulation studies are needed. Roughly 10,000 seems sufficient. However, paying someone to simulate 10,000 studies by hand is a waste of time and money. Instead, simulations are typically programmed into a computer, which is much more efficient. Figure 5.9 shows the results of 10,000 simulated studies. The proportions that are equal to or less than \\(\\hat{p}=0.048\\) are shaded. The shaded areas represent sample proportions under the null distribution that provide at least as much evidence as \\(\\hat{p}\\) favoring the alternative hypothesis. There were 1222 simulated sample proportions with \\(\\hat{p}_{sim} \\leq 0.048\\). We use these to construct the null distribution’s left-tail area and find the p-value: \\[\\begin{align} \\text{left tail area }\\label{estOfPValueBasedOnSimulatedNullForSingleProportion} &amp;= \\frac{\\text{Number of observed simulations with }\\hat{p}_{sim}\\leq\\text{ 0.048}}{10000} \\end{align}\\] Of the 10,000 simulated \\(\\hat{p}_{sim}\\), 1222 were equal to or smaller than \\(\\hat{p}\\). Since the hypothesis test is one-sided, the estimated p-value is equal to this tail area: 0.1222. Figure 5.9: The null distribution for \\(\\hat{p}\\), created from 10,000 simulated studies. The left tail, representing the p-value for the hypothesis test, contains 12.22% of the simulations. Because the estimated p-value is 0.1222, which is not small, we have little to no evidence against the null hypothesis. Explain what this means in plain language in the context of the problem.73 Does the conclusion in the previous Guided Practice imply there is no real association between the surgical consultant’s work and the risk of complications? Explain.74 Regardless of the statistical method chosen, the p-value is always derived by analyzing the null distribution of the test statistic. The normal model poorly approximates the null distribution for \\(\\hat{p}\\) when the success-failure condition is not satisfied. As a substitute, we can generate the null distribution using simulated sample proportions and use this distribution to compute the tail area, i.e., the p-value. Neither the p-value approximated by the normal distribution nor the simulated p-value are exact, because the normal distribution and simulated null distribution themselves are not exact, only a close approximation. An exact p-value can be generated using the binomial distribution, but that method will not be covered in this text. Theory-based method for calculating the p-value In Section 5.1.2, we introduced the normal distribution and showed how it can be used as a mathematical model to describe the variability of a sample mean or sample proportion as a result of the Central Limit Theorem. We explored the normal distribution further in Section 5.2. There are conditions under which a sample proportion \\(\\hat{p}\\) is well-modeled using a normal distribution. When the sample observations are independent and the sample size is sufficiently large, the normal model will describe the variability quite well; when the observations violate the conditions, the normal model can be inaccurate. Sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\). The sampling distribution for \\(\\hat{p}\\) based on a sample of size \\(n\\) from a population with a true proportion \\(\\pi\\) is nearly normal when: The sample’s observations are independent, e.g., are from a simple random sample. We expected to see at least 10 successes and 10 failures in the sample, i.e., \\(n\\pi\\geq10\\) and \\(n(1-\\pi)\\geq10\\). This is called the success-failure condition. When these conditions are met, then the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) is nearly normal with mean \\(\\pi\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\ \\pi(1-\\pi)\\ }{n}}\\). The success-failure condition listed above is only necessary for the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) to be approximately normal. The mean of the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) is \\(\\pi\\), and the standard deviation is \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\ \\pi(1-\\pi)\\ }{n}}\\), regardless of the sample size. Typically we don’t know the true proportion \\(\\pi\\), so we substitute some value to check the success-failure condition and to estimate the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\). The independence condition is a more nuanced requirement. When it isn’t met, it is important to understand how and why it isn’t met. For example, there exist no statistical methods available to truly correct the inherent biases of data from a convenience sample. On the other hand, if we took a cluster random sample (see Section ??), the observations wouldn’t be independent, but suitable statistical methods are available for analyzing the data (but they are beyond the scope of even most second or third courses in statistics)75. In the examples based on large sample theory, we modeled \\(\\hat{p}\\) using the normal distribution. Why is this not appropriate for the study on the medical consultant? The independence assumption may be reasonable if each of the surgeries is from a different surgical team. However, the success-failure condition is not satisfied. Under the null hypothesis, we would anticipate seeing \\(62\\times 0.10=6.2\\) complications, not the 10 required for the normal approximation. Since theory-based methods cannot be used on the medical consultant example, we’ll turn to another example to demonstrate these methods, where conditions for approximating the distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) by a normal distribution are met. One possible regulation for payday lenders is that they would be required to do a credit check and evaluate debt payments against the borrower’s finances. We would like to know: would borrowers support this form of regulation? Set up hypotheses to evaluate whether borrowers have a majority support for this type of regulation.76 To apply the normal distribution to model the null distribution, the independence and success-failure conditions must be satisfied. In a hypothesis test, the success-failure condition is checked using the null proportion: we verify \\(np_0\\) and \\(n(1-p_0)\\) are at least 10, where \\(p_0\\) is the null value. Do payday loan borrowers support a regulation that would require lenders to pull their credit report and evaluate their debt payments? From a random sample of 826 borrowers, 51% said they would support such a regulation. Is it reasonable use a normal distribution to model \\(\\hat{p}\\) for a hypothesis test here?77 Using the hypotheses and data from the previous two Guided Practices, evaluate whether the poll on lending regulations provides convincing evidence that a majority of payday loan borrowers support a new regulation that would require lenders to pull credit reports and evaluate debt payments. With hypotheses already set up and conditions checked, we can move onto calculations. The standard error in the context of a one-proportion hypothesis test is computed using the null value, \\(p_0\\): \\[\\begin{align*} SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_0 (1 - p_0)}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.5 (1 - 0.5)}{826}} = 0.017 \\end{align*}\\] A picture of the normal model for null distribution of sample proportions is shown below in Figure ??, with the p-value represented by the shaded region. Note that this distribution is centered at 0.50, the null value, and has standard deviation 0.017. Under \\(H_0\\), the probability of observing \\(\\hat{p} = 0.51\\) or higher is 0.278, the area above 0.51 on the null distribution. With a p-value of 0.278, the poll does not provide convincing evidence that a majority of payday loan borrowers support regulations around credit checks and evaluation of debt payments. You’ll note that this conclusion is somewhat unsatisfactory because there is no conclusion, as is the case with larger p-values. That is, there is no resolution one way or the other about public opinion. We cannot claim that exactly 50% of people support the regulation, but we cannot claim a majority support it either. Often, with theory-based methods, we use a standardized statistic rather than the original statistic. A standardized statistic is computed by subtracting the mean of the null distribution from the original statistic, then dividing by the standard error. When we are modeling the null distribution with a normal distribution, this standardized statistic is called \\(Z\\), since it is the \\(Z-score\\) of the sample proportion. Standardized sample proportion. The standardized statistic for theory-based methods for one proportion is \\[ Z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}} \\] where \\(p_0\\) is the null value. The denominator, \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}\\), is called the null standard error. With the standardized statistic as our test statistic, we can find the p-value as the area under a standard normal distribution. Do payday loan borrowers support a regulation that would require lenders to pull their credit report and evaluate their debt payments? From a random sample of 826 borrowers, 51% said they would support such a regulation. We set up hypotheses and checked conditions previously. Now calculate and interpret the standardized statistic, then use the standard normal distribution to calculate the approximate p-value. Our sample proportion is \\(\\hat{p} = 0.51\\). Since our null value is \\(p_0 = 0.50\\), the null standard error is \\[\\begin{align*} SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_0 (1 - p_0)}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.5 (1 - 0.5)}{826}} = 0.017 \\end{align*}\\] The standardized statistic is \\[\\begin{align*} Z = \\frac{0.51 - 0.50}{0.017} = 0.57 \\end{align*}\\] Interpreting this value, we can say that our sample proportion of 0.51 was only 0.57 standard errors above the null value of 0.50. The p-value is the area above \\(Z = 0.57\\) on a standard normal distribution—0.278—the same p-value we would obtain by finding the area above \\(\\hat{p} = 0.51\\) on a normal distribution with mean 0.50 and standard deviation 0.017. Theory-based hypothesis test for a proportion: one-sample \\(Z\\)-test. Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses. Using the null value, \\(p_0\\), verify the conditions for using the normal distribution to approximate the null distribution. Calculate the test statistic: \\[ Z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}} \\] Use the test statistic and the standard normal distribution to calculate the p-value. Make a conclusion based on the p-value, and write a conclusion in context, in plain language, and in terms of the alternative hypothesis. Violating conditions We’ve spent a lot of time discussing conditions for when \\(\\hat{p}\\) can be reasonably modeled by a normal distribution. What happens when the success-failure condition fails? What about when the independence condition fails? In either case, the general ideas of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests remain the same, but the strategy or technique used to generate the interval or p-value change. When the success-failure condition isn’t met for a hypothesis test, we can simulate the null distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) using the null value, \\(p_0\\), as seen in Section 5.3.1. Unfortunately, methods for dealing with observations which are not independent are outside the scope of this book. 5.3.2 Confidence interval for \\(\\pi\\) A confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the parameter \\(\\pi\\), and when \\(\\hat{p}\\) can be modeled using a normal distribution, the confidence interval for \\(p\\) takes the form \\[\\begin{align*} \\hat{p} \\pm z^{\\star} \\times SE. \\end{align*}\\] We have seen \\(\\hat{p}\\) to be the sample proportion. The value \\(z^{\\star}\\) comes from a standard normal distribution and is determined by the chosen confidence level. The value of the standard error, \\(SE\\), approximates how far we would expect the sample proportion to fall from \\(\\pi\\), and depends heavily on the sample size. Standard error of one proportion, \\(\\hat{p}\\). When the conditions are met so that the distribution fo \\(\\hat{p}\\) is nearly normal, the variability of a single proportion, \\(\\hat{p}\\) is well described by its standard deviation: \\[SD(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi(1-\\pi)}{n}}\\] Note that we almost never know the true value of \\(\\pi\\), but we can substitute our best guess of \\(\\pi\\) to obtain an approximate standard deviation, called the standard error of \\(\\hat{p}\\): \\[SD(\\hat{p}) \\approx \\hspace{3mm} SE(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\mbox{best guess of }\\pi)(1 - \\mbox{best guess of }\\pi)}{n}}\\] For hypothesis testing, we often use \\(p_0\\) as the best guess of \\(\\pi\\), as seen in Section 5.3.1. For confidence intervals, we typically use \\(\\hat{p}\\) as the best guess of \\(\\pi\\). Consider taking many polls of registered voters (i.e., random samples) of size 300 and asking them if they support legalized marijuana. It is suspected that about 2/3 of all voters support legalized marijuana. To understand how the sample proportion (\\(\\hat{p}\\)) would vary across the samples, calculate the standard error of \\(\\hat{p}\\).78 A simple random sample of 826 payday loan borrowers was surveyed to better understand their interests around regulation and costs. 70% of the responses supported new regulations on payday lenders. Is it reasonable to model the variability of \\(\\hat{p}\\) from sample to sample using a normal distribution? Calculate the standard error of \\(\\hat{p}\\). Construct a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\pi\\), the proportion of all payday borrowers who support increased regulation for payday lenders. The data are a random sample, so the observations are independent and representative of the population of interest. We also must check the success-failure condition, which we do using \\(\\hat{p}\\) in place of \\(\\pi\\) when computing a confidence interval: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Support: } n \\hat{p} &amp; == 826 \\times 0.70 \\approx 578 &amp;\\text{Not: } n (1 - \\hat{p}) &amp; = 826 \\times (1 - 0.70) \\approx 248 \\end{align*}\\] Since both values are at least 10, we can use the normal distribution to model the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\). Because \\(\\pi\\) is unknown and the standard error is for a confidence interval, use \\(\\hat{p}\\) as our best guess of \\(\\pi\\) in the formula. \\(SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.70 (1 - 0.70)} {826}} = 0.016\\). Using the point estimate 0.70, \\(z^{\\star} = 1.96\\) for a 95% confidence interval, and the standard error \\(SE = 0.016\\) from the previous Guided Practice, the confidence interval is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\text{point estimate} \\ \\pm\\ z^{\\star} \\times SE \\quad\\to\\quad 0.70 \\ \\pm\\ 1.96 \\times 0.016 \\quad\\to\\quad (0.669, 0.731) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] We are 95% confident that the true proportion of payday borrowers who supported regulation at the time of the poll was between 0.669 and 0.731. Constructing a confidence interval for a single proportion. There are three steps to constructing a confidence interval for \\(p\\). Check independence and the success-failure condition using \\(\\hat{p}\\). If the conditions are met, the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) may be well-approximated by the normal model. Construct the standard error using \\(\\hat{p}\\) in place of \\(p\\) in the standard error formula. Apply the general confidence interval formula. 5.3.2.1 z^$ and the confidence level Suppose we want to consider confidence intervals where the confidence level is somewhat higher than 95%: perhaps we would like a confidence level of 99%. Think back to the analogy about trying to catch a fish: if we want to be more sure that we will catch the fish, we should use a wider net. To create a 99% confidence level, we must also widen our 95% interval. On the other hand, if we want an interval with lower confidence, such as 90%, we could make our original 95% interval slightly slimmer. The 95% confidence interval structure provides guidance in how to make intervals with new confidence levels. Below is a general 95% confidence interval for a point estimate that comes from a nearly normal distribution: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\text{point estimate}\\ \\pm\\ 1.96\\times SE \\end{eqnarray}\\] There are three components to this interval: the point estimate, “1.96”, and the standard error. The choice of \\(1.96\\times SE\\) was based on capturing 95% of the data since the estimate is within 1.96 standard errors of the true value about 95% of the time. The choice of 1.96 corresponds to a 95% confidence level. If \\(X\\) is a normally distributed random variable, how often will \\(X\\) be within 2.58 standard deviations of the mean?79 Figure 5.10: The area between -\\(z^{\\star}\\) and \\(z^{\\star}\\) increases as \\(|z^{\\star}|\\) becomes larger. If the confidence level is 99%, we choose \\(z^{\\star}\\) such that 99% of the normal curve is between -\\(z^{\\star}\\) and \\(z^{\\star}\\), which corresponds to 0.5% in the lower tail and 0.5% in the upper tail: \\(z^{\\star}=2.58\\). To create a 99% confidence interval, change 1.96 in the 95% confidence interval formula to be \\(2.58\\). The previous Guided Practice highlights that 99% of the time a normal random variable will be within 2.58 standard deviations of its mean. This approach – using the Z-scores in the normal model to compute confidence levels – is appropriate when the point estimate is associated with a normal distribution and we can properly compute the standard error. Thus, the formula for a 99% confidence interval is: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\text{point estimate}\\ \\pm\\ 2.58\\times SE \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The normal approximation is crucial to the precision of the \\(z^\\star\\) confidence intervals (in contrast to the bootstrap confidence intervals). When the normal model is not a good fit, we will use alternative distributions that better characterize the sampling distribution or we will use bootstrapping procedures. Create a 99% confidence interval for the impact of the stent on the risk of stroke using the data from Section 1.1. The point estimate is 0.090, and the standard error is \\(SE = 0.028\\). It has been verified for you that the point estimate can reasonably be modeled by a normal distribution.80 Mathematical model confidence interval for any confidence level. If the point estimate follows the normal model with standard error \\(SE\\), then a confidence interval for the population parameter is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\text{point estimate}\\ \\pm\\ z^{\\star} \\times SE \\end{eqnarray*}\\] where \\(z^{\\star}\\) corresponds to the confidence level selected. Figure 5.10 provides a picture of how to identify \\(z^{\\star}\\) based on a confidence level. We select \\(z^{\\star}\\) so that the area between -\\(z^{\\star}\\) and \\(z^{\\star}\\) in the normal model corresponds to the confidence level. Previously, we found that implanting a stent in the brain of a patient at risk for a stroke increased the risk of a stroke. The study estimated a 9% increase in the number of patients who had a stroke, and the standard error of this estimate was about \\(SE = 2.8%\\). Compute a 90% confidence interval for the effect.81 Add tappers and listeners case study example from old Ch. 5 here. 5.4 Difference of two proportions Notation. \\(n_1\\), \\(n_2\\) = sample sizes of two independent samples \\(\\hat{p}_1\\), \\(\\hat{p}_2\\) = sample proportions of two independent samples \\(\\pi_1\\), \\(\\pi_2\\) = population proportions of two independent samples We now extend the methods from Section 5.3 to apply confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to differences in population proportions that come from two groups: \\(\\pi_1 - \\pi_2\\). In our investigations, we’ll identify a reasonable point estimate of \\(p_1 - p_2\\) based on the sample, and you may have already guessed its form: \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\). Then we’ll look at the inferential analysis in three different ways: using a randomization test, applying bootstrapping for interval estimates, and, if we verify that the point estimate can be modeled using a normal distribution, we compute the estimate’s standard error, and we apply the mathematical framework. 5.4.1 Randomization test for \\(H_0: p_1 - p_2 = 0\\) Observed data We consider a study on a new malaria vaccine called PfSPZ. In this study, volunteer patients were randomized into one of two experiment groups: 14 patients received an experimental vaccine or 6 patients received a placebo vaccine. Nineteen weeks later, all 20 patients were exposed to a drug-sensitive malaria virus strain; the motivation of using a drug-sensitive strain of virus here is for ethical considerations, allowing any infections to be treated effectively. The results are summarized in Table 5.3, where 9 of the 14 treatment patients remained free of signs of infection while all of the 6 patients in the control group patients showed some baseline signs of infection. Table 5.3: Summary results for the malaria vaccine experiment. outcome infection no infection Total vaccine 5 9 14 treatment placebo 6 0 6 Total 11 9 20 Is this an observational study or an experiment? What implications does the study type have on what can be inferred from the results?82 In this study, a smaller proportion of patients who received the vaccine showed signs of an infection (35.7% versus 100%). However, the sample is very small, and it is unclear whether the difference provides convincing evidence that the vaccine is effective. As we saw in Section ??, we can randomize the responses (infection or no infection) to the treatment conditions under the null hypothesis of independence and compute possible differences in proportions. The process by which we randomize observations to two groups is summarized and visualized in Figure ??. Variability of the statistic Figure 5.11 shows a stacked plot of the differences found from 100 randomization simulations (i.e., repeated iterations as described in Figure ??), where each dot represents a simulated difference between the infection rates (control rate minus treatment rate). Figure 5.11: A stacked dot plot of differences from 100 simulations produced under the independence model \\(H_0\\), where in these simulations infections are unaffected by the vaccine. Two of the 100 simulations had a difference of at least 64.3%, the difference observed in the study. Observed statistic vs null statistics Note that the distribution of these simulated differences is centered around 0. We simulated the differences assuming that the independence model was true, and under this condition, we expect the difference to be near zero with some random fluctuation, where near is pretty generous in this case since the sample sizes are so small in this study. How often would you observe a difference of at least 64.3% (0.643) according to Figure 5.11? Often, sometimes, rarely, or never? It appears that a difference of at least 64.3% due to chance alone would only happen about 2% of the time according to Figure 5.11. Such a low probability indicates a rare event. The difference of 64.3% being a rare event suggests two possible interpretations of the results of the study: \\(H_0\\) Independence model. The vaccine has no effect on infection rate, and we just happened to observe a difference that would only occur on a rare occasion. \\(H_A\\) Alternative model. The vaccine has an effect on infection rate, and the difference we observed was actually due to the vaccine being effective at combating malaria, which explains the large difference of 64.3%. Based on the simulations, we have two options: We conclude that the study results do not provide strong evidence against the independence model. That is, we do not have sufficiently strong evidence to conclude the vaccine had an effect in this clinical setting. We conclude the evidence is sufficiently strong to reject \\(H_0\\) and assert that the vaccine was useful. When we conduct formal studies, usually we reject the notion that we just happened to observe a rare event.83 In this case, we reject the independence model in favor of the alternative. That is, we are concluding the data provide strong evidence that the vaccine provides some protection against malaria in this clinical setting. Statistical inference, is built on evaluating whether such differences are due to chance. In statistical inference, data scientists evaluate which model is most reasonable given the data. Errors do occur, just like rare events, and we might choose the wrong model. While we do not always choose correctly, statistical inference gives us tools to control and evaluate how often these errors occur. Decision errors Hypothesis tests are not flawless. Just think of the court system: innocent people are sometimes wrongly convicted and the guilty sometimes walk free. Similarly, data can point to the wrong conclusion. However, what distinguishes statistical hypothesis tests from a court system is that our framework allows us to quantify and control how often the data lead us to the incorrect conclusion. In a hypothesis test, there are two competing hypotheses: the null and the alternative. We make a statement about which one might be true, but we might choose incorrectly. There are four possible scenarios in a hypothesis test, which are summarized in Table 5.4. Table 5.4: Four different scenarios for hypothesis tests. Test conclusion \\(H_0\\) true good decision Type 1 Error Truth \\(H_A\\) true Type 2 Error good decision A Type 1 Error is rejecting the null hypothesis when \\(H_0\\) is actually true. Since we rejected the null hypothesis in the gender discrimination and opportunity cost studies, it is possible that we made a Type 1 Error in one or both of those studies. A Type 2 Error is failing to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative is actually true. In a US court, the defendant is either innocent (\\(H_0\\)) or guilty (\\(H_A\\)). What does a Type 1 Error represent in this context? What does a Type 2 Error represent? Table 5.4 may be useful. If the court makes a Type 1 Error, this means the defendant is innocent (\\(H_0\\) true) but wrongly convicted. A Type 2 Error means the court failed to reject \\(H_0\\) (i.e., failed to convict the person) when they were in fact guilty (\\(H_A\\) true). Consider the opportunity cost study where we concluded students were less likely to make a DVD purchase if they were reminded that money not spent now could be spent later. What would a Type 1 Error represent in this context?84 How could we reduce the Type 1 Error rate in US courts? What influence would this have on the Type 2 Error rate? To lower the Type 1 Error rate, we might raise our standard for conviction from “beyond a reasonable doubt” to “beyond a conceivable doubt” so fewer people would be wrongly convicted. However, this would also make it more difficult to convict the people who are actually guilty, so we would make more Type 2 Errors. How could we reduce the Type 2 Error rate in US courts? What influence would this have on the Type 1 Error rate?85 The example and guided practice above provide an important lesson: if we reduce how often we make one type of error, we generally make more of the other type. Choosing a significance level Choosing a significance level for a test is important in many contexts, and the traditional level is 0.05. However, it is sometimes helpful to adjust the significance level based on the application. We may select a level that is smaller or larger than 0.05 depending on the consequences of any conclusions reached from the test. If making a Type 1 Error is dangerous or especially costly, we should choose a small significance level (e.g., 0.01 or 0.001). If we want to be very cautious about rejecting the null hypothesis, we demand very strong evidence favoring the alternative \\(H_A\\) before we would reject \\(H_0\\). If a Type 2 Error is relatively more dangerous or much more costly than a Type 1 Error, then we should choose a higher significance level (e.g., 0.10). Here we want to be cautious about failing to reject \\(H_0\\) when the null is actually false. Significance levels should reflect consequences of errors. The significance level selected for a test should reflect the real-world consequences associated with making a Type 1 or Type 2 Error. Two-sided hypotheses In Section ?? we explored whether women were discriminated against and whether a simple trick could make students a little thriftier. In these two case studies, we’ve actually ignored some possibilities: What if men are actually discriminated against? What if the money trick actually makes students spend more? These possibilities weren’t considered in our original hypotheses or analyses. The disregard of the extra alternatives may have seemed natural since the data pointed in the directions in which we framed the problems. However, there are two dangers if we ignore possibilities that disagree with our data or that conflict with our world view: Framing an alternative hypothesis simply to match the direction that the data point will generally inflate the Type 1 Error rate. After all the work we’ve done (and will continue to do) to rigorously control the error rates in hypothesis tests, careless construction of the alternative hypotheses can disrupt that hard work. If we only use alternative hypotheses that agree with our worldview, then we’re going to be subjecting ourselves to confirmation bias, which means we are looking for data that supports our ideas. That’s not very scientific, and we can do better! The original hypotheses we’ve seen are called one-sided hypothesis tests because they only explored one direction of possibilities. Such hypotheses are appropriate when we are exclusively interested in the single direction, but usually we want to consider all possibilities. To do so, let’s learn about two-sided hypothesis tests in the context of a new study that examines the impact of using blood thinners on patients who have undergone CPR. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a procedure used on individuals suffering a heart attack when other emergency resources are unavailable. This procedure is helpful in providing some blood circulation to keep a person alive, but CPR chest compressions can also cause internal injuries. Internal bleeding and other injuries that can result from CPR complicate additional treatment efforts. For instance, blood thinners may be used to help release a clot that is causing the heart attack once a patient arrives in the hospital. However, blood thinners negatively affect internal injuries. Here we consider an experiment with patients who underwent CPR for a heart attack and were subsequently admitted to a hospital.86 Each patient was randomly assigned to either receive a blood thinner (treatment group) or not receive a blood thinner (control group). The outcome variable of interest was whether the patient survived for at least 24 hours. Form hypotheses for this study in plain and statistical language. Let \\(p_c\\) represent the true survival rate of people who do not receive a blood thinner (corresponding to the control group) and \\(p_t\\) represent the survival rate for people receiving a blood thinner (corresponding to the treatment group). We want to understand whether blood thinners are helpful or harmful. We’ll consider both of these possibilities using a two-sided hypothesis test. \\(H_0\\): Blood thinners do not have an overall survival effect, i.e., the survival proportions are the same in each group. \\(p_t - p_c = 0\\). \\(H_A\\): Blood thinners have an impact on survival, either positive or negative, but not zero. \\(p_t - p_c \\neq 0\\). Note that if we had done a one-sided hypothesis test, the resulting hypotheses would have been: \\(H_0\\): Blood thinners do not have a positive overall survival effect, i.e., the survival proportions for the blood thinner group is the same or lower than the control group. \\(p_t - p_c \\leq 0\\). \\(H_A\\): Blood thinners have a positive impact on survival. \\(p_t - p_c &gt; 0\\). There were 50 patients in the experiment who did not receive a blood thinner and 40 patients who did. The study results are shown in Table 5.5. Table 5.5: Results for the CPR study. Patients in the treatment group were given a blood thinner, and patients in the control group were not Survived Died Total Control 11 39 50 Treatment 14 26 40 Total 25 65 90 What is the observed survival rate in the control group? And in the treatment group? Also, provide a point estimate of the difference in survival proportions of the two groups: \\(\\hat{p}_t - \\hat{p}_c\\).87 According to the point estimate, for patients who have undergone CPR outside of the hospital, an additional 13% of these patients survive when they are treated with blood thinners. However, we wonder if this difference could be easily explainable by chance. As we did in our past two studies this chapter, we will simulate what type of differences we might see from chance alone under the null hypothesis. By randomly assigning “simulated treatment” and “simulated control” stickers to the patients’ files, we get a new grouping. If we repeat this simulation 10,000 times, we can build a null distribution of the differences shown in Figure 5.12. Figure 5.12: Null distribution of the point estimate for the difference in proportions, \\(\\hat{p}_t - \\hat{p}_c\\). The shaded right tail shows observations that are at least as large as the observed difference, 0.13. The right tail area is 0.131. (Note: it is only a coincidence that we also have \\(\\hat{p}_t - \\hat{p}_c=0.13\\).) However, contrary to how we calculated the p-value in previous studies, the p-value of this test is not 0.131! The p-value is defined as the chance we observe a result at least as favorable to the alternative hypothesis as the result (i.e., the difference) we observe. In this case, any differences less than or equal to -0.13 would also provide equally strong evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis as a difference of +0.13 did. A difference of -0.13 would correspond to 13% higher survival rate in the control group than the treatment group. In Figure 5.13 we’ve also shaded these differences in the left tail of the distribution. These two shaded tails provide a visual representation of the p-value for a two-sided test. Figure 5.13: Null distribution of the point estimate for the difference in proportions, \\(\\hat{p}_t - \\hat{p}_c\\). All values that are at least as extreme as +0.13 but in either direction away from 0 are shaded. For a two-sided test, take the single tail (in this case, 0.131) and double it to get the p-value: 0.262. Since this p-value is larger than 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis. That is, we do not find statistically significant evidence that the blood thinner has any influence on survival of patients who undergo CPR prior to arriving at the hospital. Default to a two-sided test. We want to be rigorous and keep an open mind when we analyze data and evidence. Use a one-sided hypothesis test only if you truly have interest in only one direction. Computing a p-value for a two-sided test. First compute the p-value for one tail of the distribution, then double that value to get the two-sided p-value. That’s it! Consider the situation of the medical consultant. Now that you know about one-sided and two-sided tests, which type of test do you think is more appropriate? The setting has been framed in the context of the consultant being helpful (which is what led us to a one-sided test originally), but what if the consultant actually performed worse than the average? Would we care? More than ever! Since it turns out that we care about a finding in either direction, we should run a two-sided test. The p-value for the two-sided test is double that of the one-sided test, here the simulated p-value would be 0.2444. Generally, to find a two-sided p-value we double the single tail area, which remains a reasonable approach even when the sampling distribution is asymmetric. However, the approach can result in p-values larger than 1 when the point estimate is very near the mean in the null distribution; in such cases, we write that the p-value is 1. Also, very large p-values computed in this way (e.g., 0.85), may also be slightly inflated. Typically, we do not worry too much about the precision of very large p-values because they lead to the same analysis conclusion, even if the value is slightly off. Controlling the Type 1 Error rate Now that we understand the difference between one-sided and two-sided tests, we must recognize when to use each type of test. Because of the result of increased error rates, it is never okay to change two-sided tests to one-sided tests after observing the data. We explore the consequences of ignoring this advice in the next example. Using \\(\\alpha=0.05\\), we show that freely switching from two-sided tests to one-sided tests will lead us to make twice as many Type 1 Errors as intended. Suppose we are interested in finding any difference from 0. We’ve created a smooth-looking null distribution representing differences due to chance in Figure 5.14. Suppose the sample difference was larger than 0. Then if we can flip to a one-sided test, we would use \\(H_A\\): difference \\(&gt; 0\\). Now if we obtain any observation in the upper 5% of the distribution, we would reject \\(H_0\\) since the p-value would just be a the single tail. Thus, if the null hypothesis is true, we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis about 5% of the time when the sample mean is above the null value, as shown in Figure 5.14. Suppose the sample difference was smaller than 0. Then if we change to a one-sided test, we would use \\(H_A\\): difference \\(&lt; 0\\). If the observed difference falls in the lower 5% of the figure, we would reject \\(H_0\\). That is, if the null hypothesis is true, then we would observe this situation about 5% of the time. By examining these two scenarios, we can determine that we will make a Type 1 Error \\(5\\%+5\\%=10\\%\\) of the time if we are allowed to swap to the “best” one-sided test for the data. This is twice the error rate we prescribed with our significance level: \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) (!). Figure 5.14: The shaded regions represent areas where we would reject \\(H_0\\) under the bad practices considered in when \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). Hypothesis tests should be set up before seeing the data. After observing data, it is tempting to turn a two-sided test into a one-sided test. Avoid this temptation. Hypotheses should be set up before observing the data. 5.4.2 Bootstrap confidence interval for \\(p_1 - p_2\\) The key will be to use two different bags to simulate from the original data. Use the CPR data. After we find the CI (use percentile and SE methods), write the interval values down below in the math section that describes the generic confidence interval method. In Section 5.4.1, we worked with the randomization distribution to understand the distribution of \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\) when the null hypothesis \\(H_0: p_1 - p_2 = 0\\) is true. Now, through bootstrapping, we study the variability of \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\) without the null assumption. Observed data Reconsider the CPR data from Section 5.4.1 which is provided in Table 5.5. The experiment consisted of two treatments on patients who underwent CPR for a heart attack and were subsequently admitted to a hospital. Each patient was randomly assigned to either receive a blood thinner (treatment group) or not receive a blood thinner (control group). The outcome variable of interest was whether the patient survived for at least 24 hours. Again, we use the difference in sample proportions as the observed statistic of interest. Here, the value of the statistic is: \\(\\hat{p}_t - \\hat{p}_c = 0.35 - 0.22 = 0.13\\). Variability of the statistic The bootstrap method applied to two samples is an extension of the method described in Section ??. Now, we have two samples, so each sample estimates the population from which they came. In the CPR setting, the treatment sample estimates the population of all individuals who have gotten (or will get) the treatment; the control sample estimate the population of all individuals who do not get the treatment and are controls. Figure 5.15 extends Figure ?? to show the bootstrapping process from two samples simultaneously. Figure 5.15: (probably populations only, no BS samples) two sample estimating two populations (two infinite popuations) The variability of the statistic (the difference in sample proportions) can be calculated by taking one treatment bootstrap sample and one control bootstrap sample and calculating the difference of the bootstrap survival proportions. One sample from each of the estimated populations has been taken with the sample proportions calculated for the treatment bootstrap sample and the control bootstrap sample. once the image is in, we need to describe above (and below) the values (proportions, differences) in the image explicitly. Figure 5.16: some way to connect the first BS sample on the left wiht the first BS sample on the right. As always, the variability of the difference in proportions can only be estimated by repeated simulations, in this case, repeated bootstrap samples. Figure 5.16 shows multiple bootstrap differences calculated for each of the repeated bootstrap samples. Figure 5.17: in this graph, some kind of connection between each of the two sides Do we also want to visualize “sampling with replacement” in the two sample case? Repeated bootstrap simulations lead to a bootstrap sampling distribution of the statistic of interest, here the difference in sample proportions. Figure 5.18 shows 1000 bootstrap differences in proportions for the CPR data. Figure 5.18: A histogram of differences in proportions from 1000 bootstrap simulations. Percentile vs. SE bootstrap confidence intervals Figure 5.18 provides an estimate for the variability of the difference in survival proportions from sample to sample, The values in the histogram can be used in two different ways to create a confidence interval for the parameter of interest: \\(p_1 - p_2\\). Percentile bootstrap interval As in Section ??, the bootstrap confidence interval can be calculated directly from the bootstrapped differences in Figure 5.18. The interval created from the percentiles of the distribution is called the percentile interval. Note that here we calculate the 90% confidence interval by finding the \\(5^{th}\\) and \\(95^{th}\\) percentile values from the bootstrapped differences. The bootstrap 5 percentile proportion is -0.155 and the 95 percentile is 0.167. The result is: we are 90% confident that, in the population, the true difference in probability of survival is between -0.155 and 0.167. The interval shows that we do not have much definitive evidence of the affect of blood thinners, one way or another. (#fig:CPR percentile interval)The CPR data is bootstrapped 1000 times. Each simulation creates a sample from the original data where the probability of survival in the treatment group is \\(\\hat{p}_{t} = 14/40\\) and the probability of survival in the control group is \\(\\hat{p}_{c} = 11/50\\). SE bootstrap interval Alternatively, we can use the variability in the bootstrapped differences to calculate a standard error of the difference. The resulting interval is called the SE interval. Section 5.4.3 details the mathematical model for the standard error of the difference in sample proportions, but the bootstrap distribution typically does an excellent job of estimating the variability. \\[SE(\\hat{p}_t - \\hat{p}_c) \\approx SD(\\hat{p}_{bs,t} - \\hat{p}_{bs,c}) = 0.0975\\] The calculation above was performed in R using the sd() function, but any statistical software will calculate the standard deviation of the differences, here, the exact quantity we hope to approximate. Because we don’t know the true distribution of \\(\\hat{p}_t - \\hat{p}_c\\), we will use a rough approximation to find a confidence interval for \\(p_t - p_c\\). A 95% confidence interval for \\(p_t - p_c\\) is given by: \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{p}_t - \\hat{p}_c &amp;\\pm&amp; 2 SE(\\hat{p}_t - \\hat{p}_c)\\\\ 14/40 - 11/50 &amp;\\pm&amp; 0.0975\\\\ &amp;&amp;(-0.065, 0.325) \\end{align}\\] We are 95% confident that the true value of \\(p_t - p_c\\) is between -0.065 and 0.325. Again, the wide confidence interval that overlaps zero indicates that the study provides very little evidence about the effectiveness of blood thinners. 5.4.3 Mathematical model Variability of \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\) Like with \\(\\hat{p}\\), the difference of two sample proportions \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\) can be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met. First, we require a broader independence condition, and secondly, the success-failure condition must be met by both groups. Conditions for the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{p}_1 -\\hat{p}_2\\) to be normal. The difference \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\) can be modeled using a normal distribution when Independence, extended. The data are independent within and between the two groups. Generally this is satisfied if the data come from two independent random samples or if the data come from a randomized experiment. Success-failure condition. The success-failure condition holds for both groups, where we check successes and failures in each group separately. When these conditions are satisfied, the standard error of \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\) is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] where \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) represent the population proportions, and \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) represent the sample sizes. Confidence interval for \\(p_1 - p_2\\) We can apply the generic confidence interval formula for a difference of two proportions, where we use \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\) as the point estimate and substitute the \\(SE\\) formula: \\[\\begin{align*} &amp;\\text{point estimate} \\ \\pm\\ z^{\\star} \\times SE &amp;&amp;\\to &amp;&amp;\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2 \\ \\pm\\ z^{\\star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}} \\end{align*}\\] Standard error of the difference in two proportions, \\(\\hat{p}_1 -\\hat{p}_2\\). When the conditions are met so that the distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) is nearly normal, the variability of the difference in proportions, \\(\\hat{p}_1 -\\hat{p}_2\\), is well described by: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} SE(\\hat{p}_1 -\\hat{p}_2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] We reconsider the experiment for patients who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for a heart attack and were subsequently admitted to a hospital. These patients were randomly divided into a treatment group where they received a blood thinner or the control group where they did not receive a blood thinner. The outcome variable of interest was whether the patients survived for at least 24 hours. The results are shown in Table 5.5. Check whether we can model the difference in sample proportions using the normal distribution. We first check for independence: since this is a randomized experiment, this condition is satisfied. Next, we check the success-failure condition for each group. We have at least 10 successes and 10 failures in each experiment arm (11, 14, 39, 26), so this condition is also satisfied. With both conditions satisfied, the difference in sample proportions can be reasonably modeled using a normal distribution for these data. Create and interpret a 90% confidence interval of the difference for the survival rates in the CPR study. We’ll use \\(p_t\\) for the survival rate in the treatment group and \\(p_c\\) for the control group: \\[\\begin{align*} \\hat{p}_{t} - \\hat{p}_{c} = \\frac{14}{40} - \\frac{11}{50} = 0.35 - 0.22 = 0.13 \\end{align*}\\] We use the standard error formula previously provided. As with the one-sample proportion case, we use the sample estimates of each proportion in the formula in the confidence interval context: \\[\\begin{align*} SE \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{0.35 (1 - 0.35)}{40} + \\frac{0.22 (1 - 0.22)}{50}} = 0.095 \\end{align*}\\] For a 90% confidence interval, we use \\(z^{\\star} = 1.65\\): \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{point estimate} \\ \\pm\\ z^{\\star} \\times SE \\quad \\to \\quad 0.13 \\ \\pm\\ 1.65 \\times 0.095 \\quad \\to \\quad (-0.027, 0.287) \\end{align*}\\] We are 90% confident that blood thinners have a difference of -2.7% to +28.7% percentage point impact on survival rate for patients who are like those in the study. Because 0% is contained in the interval, we do not have enough information to say whether blood thinners help or harm heart attack patients who have been admitted after they have undergone CPR. not sure why the footnote in the guidedpractice below doesn’t show up? should be right after: “Also interpret the interval in the context of the study.” A 5-year experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of fish oils on reducing cardiovascular events, where each subject was randomized into one of two treatment groups. We’ll consider heart attack outcomes in the patients listed in Table 5.6. Create a 95% confidence interval for the effect of fish oils on heart attacks for patients who are well-represented by those in the study. Also interpret the interval in the context of the study.^[Because the patients were randomized, the subjects are independent, both within and between the two groups. The success-failure condition is also met for both groups as all counts are at least 10. This satisfies the conditions necessary to model the difference in proportions using a normal distribution. Compute the sample proportions (\\(\\hat{p}_{\\text{fish oil}} = 0.0112\\), \\(\\hat{p}_{\\text{placebo}} = 0.0155\\)), point estimate of the difference (\\(0.0112 - 0.0155 = -0.0043\\)), and standard error \\(SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0112 \\times 0.9888}{12933} + \\frac{0.0155 \\times 0.9845}{12938}} = 0.00145\\). Next, plug the values into the general formula for a confidence interval, where we’ll use a 95% confidence level with \\(z^{\\star} = 1.96\\): \\[\\begin{align*} -0.0043 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.00145 \\quad \\to \\quad (-0.0071, -0.0015) \\end{align*}\\] We are 95% confident that fish oils decreases heart attacks by 0.15 to 0.71 percentage points (off of a baseline of about 1.55%) over a 5-year period for subjects who are similar to those in the study. Because the interval is entirely below 0, and the treatment was randomly assigned the data provide strong evidence that fish oil supplements reduce heart attacks in patients like those in the study.] Table 5.6: Results for the study on n-3 fatty acid supplement and related health benefits. heart attack no event Total fish oil 145 12788 12933 placebo 200 12738 12938 Hypothesis test for \\(H_0: p_1 - p_2 = 0\\) A mammogram is an X-ray procedure used to check for breast cancer. Whether mammograms should be used is part of a controversial discussion, and it’s the topic of our next example where we learn about 2-proportion hypothesis tests when \\(H_0\\) is \\(p_1 - p_2 = 0\\) (or equivalently, \\(p_1 = p_2\\)). A 30-year study was conducted with nearly 90,000 female participants. During a 5-year screening period, each woman was randomized to one of two groups: in the first group, women received regular mammograms to screen for breast cancer, and in the second group, women received regular non-mammogram breast cancer exams. No intervention was made during the following 25 years of the study, and we’ll consider death resulting from breast cancer over the full 30-year period. Results from the study are summarized in Figure 5.7. If mammograms are much more effective than non-mammogram breast cancer exams, then we would expect to see additional deaths from breast cancer in the control group. On the other hand, if mammograms are not as effective as regular breast cancer exams, we would expect to see an increase in breast cancer deaths in the mammogram group. Table 5.7: Summary results for breast cancer study. Death from breast cancer? Yes No Mammogram 500 44,425 Control 505 44,405 Is this study an experiment or an observational study?88 Set up hypotheses to test whether there was a difference in breast cancer deaths in the mammogram and control groups.89 Using the previous example, we will check the conditions for using a normal distribution to analyze the results of the study. The details are very similar to that of confidence intervals. However, when the null hypothesis is that \\(p_1 - p_2 = 0\\), we use a special proportion called the pooled proportion to check the success-failure condition: \\[\\begin{align*} \\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}} &amp;= \\frac {\\text{# of patients who died from breast cancer in the entire study}} {\\text{# of patients in the entire study}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{500 + 505}{500 + \\text{44,425} + 505 + \\text{44,405}} \\\\ &amp;= 0.0112 \\end{align*}\\] This proportion is an estimate of the breast cancer death rate across the entire study, and it’s our best estimate of the proportions \\(p_{mgm}\\) and \\(p_{ctrl}\\) if the null hypothesis is true that \\(p_{mgm} = p_{ctrl}\\). We will also use this pooled proportion when computing the standard error. Is it reasonable to model the difference in proportions using a normal distribution in this study? Because the patients are randomized, they can be treated as independent, both within and between groups. We also must check the success-failure condition for each group. Under the null hypothesis, the proportions \\(p_{mgm}\\) and \\(p_{ctrl}\\) are equal, so we check the success-failure condition with our best estimate of these values under \\(H_0\\), the pooled proportion from the two samples, \\(\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}} = 0.0112\\): \\[\\begin{align*} \\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}} \\times n_{mgm} &amp;= 0.0112 \\times \\text{44,925} = 503 &amp; (1 - \\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}}) \\times n_{mgm} &amp;= 0.9888 \\times \\text{44,925} = \\text{44,422} \\\\ \\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}} \\times n_{ctrl} &amp;= 0.0112 \\times \\text{44,910} = 503 &amp; (1 - \\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}}) \\times n_{ctrl} &amp;= 0.9888 \\times \\text{44,910} = \\text{44,407} \\end{align*}\\] The success-failure condition is satisfied since all values are at least 10. With both conditions satisfied, we can safely model the difference in proportions using a normal distribution. Use the pooled proportion when \\(H_0\\) is \\(p_1 - p_2 = 0\\). When the null hypothesis is that the proportions are equal, use the pooled proportion (\\(\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pooled}}\\)) to verify the success-failure condition and estimate the standard error: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{p}_{\\textit{pooled}} = \\frac{\\text{number of ``successes&quot;}} {\\text{number of cases}} = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1 n_1 + \\hat{p}_2 n_2}{n_1 + n_2} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Here \\(\\hat{p}_1 n_1\\) represents the number of successes in sample 1 since \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{p}_1 = \\frac{\\text{number of successes in sample 1}}{n_1} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Similarly, \\(\\hat{p}_2 n_2\\) represents the number of successes in sample 2. In the previous example, the pooled proportion was used to check the success-failure condition90. In the next example, we see an additional place where the pooled proportion comes into play: the standard error calculation. Compute the point estimate of the difference in breast cancer death rates in the two groups, and use the pooled proportion \\(\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}} = 0.0112\\) to calculate the standard error. The point estimate of the difference in breast cancer death rates is \\[\\begin{align*} \\hat{p}_{mgm} - \\hat{p}_{ctrl} &amp;= \\frac{500}{500 + 44,425} - \\frac{505}{505 + 44,405} \\\\ &amp;= 0.01113 - 0.01125 \\\\ &amp;= -0.00012 \\end{align*}\\] The breast cancer death rate in the mammogram group was 0.012% less than in the control group. Next, the standard error is calculated , \\(\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}}\\): \\[\\begin{align*} SE = \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}}(1-\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}})} {n_{mgm}} + \\frac{\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}}(1-\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}})} {n_{ctrl}} } = 0.00070 \\end{align*}\\] Using the point estimate \\(\\hat{p}_{mgm} - \\hat{p}_{ctrl} = -0.00012\\) and standard error \\(SE = 0.00070\\), calculate a p-value for the hypothesis test and write a conclusion. Just like in past tests, we first compute a test statistic and draw a picture: \\[\\begin{align*} Z = \\frac{\\text{point estimate} - \\text{null value}}{SE} = \\frac{-0.00012 - 0}{0.00070} = -0.17 \\end{align*}\\] The lower tail area is 0.4325, which we double to get the p-value: 0.8650. Because this p-value is larger than 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis. That is, the difference in breast cancer death rates is reasonably explained by chance, and we do not observe benefits or harm from mammograms relative to a regular breast exam. Can we conclude that mammograms have no benefits or harm? Here are a few considerations to keep in mind when reviewing the mammogram study as well as any other medical study: We do not accept the null hypothesis, which means we don’t have sufficient evidence to conclude that mammograms reduce or increase breast cancer deaths. If mammograms are helpful or harmful, the data suggest the effect isn’t very large. Are mammograms more or less expensive than a non-mammogram breast exam? If one option is much more expensive than the other and doesn’t offer clear benefits, then we should lean towards the less expensive option. The study’s authors also found that mammograms led to over-diagnosis of breast cancer, which means some breast cancers were found (or thought to be found) but that these cancers would not cause symptoms during patients’ lifetimes. That is, something else would kill the patient before breast cancer symptoms appeared. This means some patients may have been treated for breast cancer unnecessarily, and this treatment is another cost to consider. It is also important to recognize that over-diagnosis can cause unnecessary physical or emotional harm to patients. These considerations highlight the complexity around medical care and treatment recommendations. Experts and medical boards who study medical treatments use considerations like those above to provide their best recommendation based on the current evidence. 5.5 Summary of Z-procedures So far in this chapter, we have seen the normal distribution applied as the appropriate mathematical model in two distinct settings. Although the two data structures are different, their similarities and differences are worth pointing out. We provide Table 5.8 partly as a mechanism for understanding \\(z\\)-procedures and partly to highlight the extremely common usage of the normal distribution in practice. You will often hear the following two \\(z\\)-procedures referred to as a one sample \\(z\\)-test (\\(z\\)-interval) and two sample \\(z\\)-test (\\(z\\)-interval). Table 5.8: Similarities of \\(z\\)-methods across one sample and two independent samples analysis of a categorical response variable. one sample two indep. samples response variable binary binary explanatory variable none binary parameter of interest proportion: \\(\\pi\\) diff in props:\\(\\pi_1 - \\pi_2\\) statistic of interest proportion: \\(\\hat{p}\\) diff in props: \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\) null standard error \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi_0(1-\\pi_0)}{n}}\\) \\(\\sqrt{\\hat{p}_{pool}(1-\\hat{p}_{pool})\\left(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}\\right)}\\) standard error \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\\) \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}_1(1-\\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{\\hat{p}_2(1-\\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}\\) conditions independence, 2. large samples (at least 10 successes and 10 failures) independence, 2. large samples (at least 10 successes and 10 failures in each sample) Hypothesis tests. When applying the normal distribution for a hypothesis test, we proceed as follows: Write appropriate hypotheses. Verify conditions for using the normal distribution. One-sample: the observations must be independent, and you must have at least 10 successes and 10 failures. For a difference of proportions: each sample must separately satisfy the one-sample conditions for the normal distribution, and the data in the groups must also be independent. Compute the statistic of interest, the null standard error, and the degrees of freedom. For \\(df\\), use \\(n-1\\) for one sample, and for two samples use either statistical software or the smaller of \\(n_1 - 1\\) and \\(n_2 - 1\\). Compute the T-score using the general formula: \\[ T = \\frac{\\mbox{statistic} - \\mbox{null value}}{\\mbox{null standard error}} \\] Use the statistical software to find the p-value using the standard normal distribution: Sign in \\(H_a\\) is \\(&lt;\\): p-value = area below Z-score Sign in \\(H_a\\) is \\(&gt;\\): p-value = area above Z-score Sign in \\(H_a\\) is \\(\\neq\\): p-value = 2 \\(\\times\\) area below \\(-|\\mbox{Z-score}|\\) Make a conclusion based on the p-value, and write a conclusion in context, in plain language, and in terms of the alternative hypothesis. Confidence intervals. Similarly, the following is how we generally compute a confidence interval using a normal distribution: Verify conditions for using the normal distribution. (See above.) Compute the statistic of interest, the standard error, and \\(z^{\\star}\\). Calculate the confidence interval using the general formula: \\[ \\mbox{statistic} \\pm\\ z^{\\star} SE. \\] Put the conclusions in context and in plain language so even non-data scientists can understand the results. 5.6 R: Inference for categorical data 5.7 Chapter 5 review 5.7.1 Terms We introduced the following terms in the chapter.

Thus, toss a coin 38 times with heads representing “guess correctly”; then calculate the proportion of tosses that landed on heads. Another option would be to 10 black cards and 10 red cards, letting red represent “guess correctly”. Shuffle the cards and draw one card, record if it is red or black, then replace the card and shuffle again. Do this 38 times and calculate the proportion of red cards observed.↩︎ To explore this further, watch this TED Talk by neurologist Vilayanur Ramachandran (The synesthesia part begins at roughly 17:40 minutes).↩︎ If you carry out the calculations, you’ll note that the upper bound is actually \\(0.89 + 0.16 = 1.05\\), but since a sample proportion cannot be greater than 1, we truncated the interval to 1.↩︎ The first possibility (We can’t read Martian, and these results just occurred by chance.) was the null hypothesis; the second possibility (We can read Martian, and these results reflect this ability.) was the alternative hypothesis.↩︎ Technically, the observed sample statistic or one more extreme in the direction of our alternative.

Knowing \\(Z_{95}=1.65\\), \\(\\mu = 1500\\), and \\(\\sigma = 300\\), we setup the Z-score formula: \\(1.65 = \\frac{x_{95} - 1500}{300}\\). We solve for \\(x_{95}\\): \\(x_{95} = 1995\\). (b) Similarly, we find \\(Z_{97.5} = 1.96\\), again setup the Z-score formula for the heights, and calculate \\(x_{97.5} = 76.5\\).↩︎ Numerical answers: (a) 0.1131.

(For a picture, see Figure 5.10.) To determine this probability, look up -2.58 and 2.58 in the normal probability table (0.0049 and 0.9951). Thus, there is a \\(0.9951-0.0049 \\approx 0.99\\) probability that the unobserved random variable \\(X\\) will be within 2.58 standard deviations of the mean.↩︎ Since the necessary conditions for applying the normal model have already been checked for us, we can go straight to the construction of the confidence interval: \\(\\text{point estimate}\\ \\pm\\ 2.58 \\times SE \\rightarrow (0.018, 0.162)\\).

Each of us observes incredibly rare events every day, events we could not possibly hope to predict. However, in the non-rigorous setting of anecdotal evidence, almost anything may appear to be a rare event, so the idea of looking for rare events in day-to-day activities is treacherous. For example, we might look at the lottery: there was only a 1 in 292 million chance that the Powerball numbers for the largest jackpot in history (January 13th, 2016) would be (04, 08, 19, 27, 34) with a Powerball of (10), but nonetheless those numbers came up! However, no matter what numbers had turned up, they would have had the same incredibly rare odds. That is, any set of numbers we could have observed would ultimately be incredibly rare. This type of situation is typical of our daily lives: each possible event in itself seems incredibly rare, but if we consider every alternative, those outcomes are also incredibly rare. We should be cautious not to misinterpret such anecdotal evidence.↩︎ Making a Type 1 Error in this context would mean that reminding students that money not spent now can be spent later does not affect their buying habits, despite the strong evidence (the data suggesting otherwise) found in the experiment. Notice that this does not necessarily mean something was wrong with the data or that we made a computational mistake. Sometimes data simply point us to the wrong conclusion, which is why scientific studies are often repeated to check initial findings.↩︎ To lower the Type 2 Error rate, we want to convict more guilty people.

The important data structure for this chapter is a quantitative response variable (that is, the outcome is numerical). The three data structures we detail are: one quantitative response variable, summarized by a single mean, one quantitative response variable which is a difference across a pair of observations, summarized by a paired mean difference, and a quantitative response variable broken down by a binary explanatory variable, summarized by a difference in means. When appropriate, each of the data structures will be analyzed using the two methods introduced in Section 5.1: simulation-based and theory-based. As we build on the inferential ideas, we will visit new foundational concepts in statistical inference. One key new idea rests in estimating how the sample mean (as opposed to the sample proportion) varies from sample to sample; the resulting value is referred to as the standard error of the mean. We will also introduce a new important mathematical model, the \\(t\\)-distribution (as the foundation for the \\(t\\)-test). To summarize a quantitative response variable, we focus on the sample mean (instead of, for example, the sample median or the range of the observations) because of the well-studied mathematical model which describes the behavior of the sample mean. The sample mean will be calculated in one group, two paired groups, and two independent groups. We will not cover mathematical models which describe other statistics, but the bootstrap and randomization techniques described below are immediately extendable to any function of the observed data. The techniques described for each setting will vary slightly, but you will be well served to find the structural similarities across the different settings. 6.1 One mean Notation. \\(n\\) = sample size \\(\\hat{x}\\) = sample mean \\(s\\) = sample standard deviation \\(\\mu\\) = population mean \\(\\sigma\\) = population standard deviation In this section, we explore the situation where we focus on a single mean of a quantitative variable, and we introduce a new simulation method, bootstrapping. Bootstrapping is best suited for modeling studies where the data have been generated through random sampling from a population. If the goal is to produce a range of possible values for a population value, then in an ideal world, we would sample data from the population again and recompute the sample mean. Then we could do it again. And again. And so on until we have a good sense of the variability of our original estimate. The ideal world where sampling data is free or extremely cheap is almost never the case, and taking repeated samples from a population is usually impossible. So, instead of using a “resample from the population” approach, bootstrapping uses a “resample from the sample” approach. Sometime the mathematical theory for how an estimate varies is well-known; this is the case for the sample proportion as seen in Section ?? and the sample mean seen later in this Chapter. However, some statistics don’t have simple theory for how they vary, and bootstrapping provides a computational approach for providing interval estimates for almost any population parameter. 6.1.1 Bootstrap confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) As an employer who subsidizes housing for your employees, you need to know the average month rental price for a three bedroom flat in Edinburgh. In order to walk through the example more clearly, let’s say that you are only able to randomly sample five Edinburgh flats (if this were a real example, you would surely be able to take a much larger sample size, possibly even being able to measure the entire population!). Figure 6.1 presents the details of the random sample of observations where the monthly rent of five flats has been recorded. Figure 6.1: 5 flats The sample average monthly rent of £ 1648 is a first guess at the price of three bedroom flats. However, as a student of statistics, you understand that one sample mean based on a sample of five observations will not necessarily equal the true population average rent for all three bedroom flats in Edinburgh. Indeed, you can see that the observed rent prices vary with a standard deviation of £ 340.232, and surely the average monthly rent would be different if a different sample of size five had been taken from the population. Fortunately, we can use bootstrapping to approximate the variability of the sample mean from sample to sample. Variability of the statistic As with the inferential ideas covered in Chapter 5, the inferential analysis methods in this chapter are grounded in quantifying how one data set differs from another when they are both taken from the same population. It doesn’t make sense to take repeated samples from the same population because if you have the means to take more samples, a larger sample size will benefit you more than the exact same sample twice. Instead, with bootstrapping, we measure how the samples behave under an estimate of the population—the sample. By taking repeated samples from the estimated population, the variability from sample to sample can be observed. Figure 6.2 shows how the unknown original population can be estimated by using many duplicates of the sample. This estimated population—consisting of infinitely many copies of the original sample—can then be used to generate bootstrapped resamples. Figure 6.2: Using the original sample of five Edinburgh flats to generate an estimated population, which is then used to generate bootstrapped resamples. This process of generating a bootstrapped sample is equivalent to sampling five flats from the original sample, with replacement. It turns out that in practice, it is very difficult for computers to work with an infinite population (with the same proportional breakdown as in the sample). However, there is a physical and computational model which produces an equivalent bootstrap distribution of the sample mean in a computationally efficient manner. Consider the observed data to be a bag of five marbles. Each marble corresponds to one flat, and is labeled by the rent price. By drawing the marbles out of the bag with replacement (after we draw one, we put it back before drawing another), we depict the same sampling process as was done with the infinitely large estimated population. Note in Figure 6.2 that when sampling the original observations, a particular data point may end up in the new sample one time, several times, or not at all. In Figure 6.2, the repeated bootstrap resamples are obviously different both from each other and from the original sample. Since the bootstrap resamples are taken from the same (estimated) population, these differences are due entirely to natural variability in the sampling procedure. By summarizing each of the bootstrap resamples (here, using the sample mean), we see, directly, the variability of the sample mean, \\(\\bar{x}\\), from sample to sample. The distribution of \\(\\hat{x}_{boot}\\) for the Edinburgh flats is shown in Figure 6.3. Figure 6.3: Distribution of bootstrapped means from 1,000 simulated bootstrapped samples generated by sampling with replacement from our original sample of five Edinburgh flats. The histogram provides a sense for the variability of the average rent values from sample to sample for samples of size 5. The bootstrapped average rent prices vary from £ 1250 to £ 1995 (with a small observed sample of size 5, a bootstrap resample can sometimes, although rarely, include only repeated measurements of the same observation). Bootstrapping. Take a random sample of size \\(n\\) from the original sample, with replacement. This is called a bootstrapped resample. Record the sample mean (or statistic of interest) from the boostrapped resample. This is called a bootstrapped statistic. Repeat steps (1) and (2) 1000s of times. Use the standard deviation of the distribution of bootstrapped statistics as your estimate for the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample means—the amount we would expect a sample mean to typically deviate from the population mean. Since this bootstrapped standard deviation of statistics is an estimate of the standard deviation of sample means—and not the actual value, which is unknown—we call this a standard error of the sample mean. Due to theory that is beyond this text, we know that the bootstrap means \\(\\bar{x}_{boot}\\) vary around the original sample mean, \\(\\bar{x}\\), in a similar way to how different sample (i.e., different data sets which would produce different \\(\\bar{x}\\) values) means vary around the true parameter \\(\\mu\\). Therefore, an interval estimate for \\(\\mu\\) can be produced using the \\(\\bar{x}_{boot}\\) values themselves.The bootstrap confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\), the population mean rent price for three bedroom flats in Edinburgh, is found by locating the middle 95% (for a 95% confidence interval) of the bootstrapped sample means in Figure @ref{fig:flatsbsmean}. 95% Bootstrap confidence interval for a population mean \\(\\mu\\). The 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the parameter \\(\\mu\\) can be obtained directly using the ordered values \\(\\bar{x}_{boot}\\) values. Consider the sorted \\(\\bar{x}_{boot}\\) values, and let \\(\\bar{x}_{boot, 0.025}\\) be the 2.5% value and \\(\\bar{x}_{boot, 0.025}\\) be the 97.5% value. The 95% confidence interval is given by: (\\(\\hat{p}_{bs, 0.025}\\), \\(\\hat{p}_{bs, 0.975}\\)) You can find confidence intervals of difference confidence levels by changing the percent of the distribution you take, e.g., locate the middle 90% of the bootstrapped statistics for a 90% confidence interval. To find the middle 95% of a distribution, which two percentiles would form its boundaries?91 Using Figure 6.3, find the 90% and 95% confidence intervals for the true mean monthly rental price of a three bedroom flat in Edinburgh. A 90% confidence interval is given by £ 1429 to £ 1876. The conclusion is that we are 90% confident that the true average rental price for three bedroom flats in Edinburgh lies somewhere between £ 1429 and £ 1876. A 95% confidence interval is given by £ 1389.75 to £ 1916. The conclusion is that we are 90% confident that the true average rental price for three bedroom flats in Edinburgh lies somewhere between £ 1389.75 and £ 1916. Bootstrap percentile confidence interval for \\(\\sigma\\) Suppose that the research question at hand seeks to understand how variable the rental price of the flats are in Edinburgh. That is, your interest is no longer in the average rental price of the flats but in the standard deviation of the rental prices of all three bedroom flats in Edinburgh, \\(\\sigma\\). You may have already realized that the sample standard deviation, \\(s\\), will work as a good point estimate for the parameter of interest: the population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\). The point estimate of the five observations is calculated to be \\(s =\\) £ 340.23. While \\(s =\\) £ 340.23 might be a good guess for \\(\\sigma\\), we prefer to have an interval Although there is a mathematical model which describes how \\(s\\) varies from sample to sample, the mathematical model will not be presented in this text. But even without the mathematical model, bootstrapping can be used to find a confidence interval for the parameter \\(\\sigma\\). Describe the bootstrap distribution for the standard deviation shown in Figure 6.4. The distribution is skewed left and centered near £ 340.23, which is the point estimate from the original data. Most observations in this distribution lie between £ 0 and £ 408.1. Using Figure 6.4, find and interpret a 90% confidence interval for the population standard deviation for three bedroom flat prices in Edinburgh.^[By looking at the percentile values in Figure 6.4, the middle 90% of the bootstrap standard deviations are given by the 5 percentile (£ 153.9) and 95 percentile (£ 385.6). That is, we are 90% confident that the true standard deviation of rent prices is between £ 153.9 and £ 385.6. Note, the problem was set up as 90% to indicate that there was not a need for a high level of confidence (such a 95% or 99%). A lower degree of confidence increases potential for error, but it also produces a more narrow interval. ] Figure 6.4: The original Edinburgh data is bootstrapped 1,000 times. The histogram provides a sense for the variability of the standard deviation of the rent values from sample to sample. Bootstrapping is not a solution to small sample sizes! The example presented above is done for a sample with only five observations. As with analysis techniques that build on mathematical models, bootstrapping works best when a large random sample has been taken from the population. Bootstrapping is a method for capturing the variability of a statistic when the mathematical model is unknown (it is not a method for navigating small samples). As you might guess, the larger the random sample, the more accurately that sample will represent the population of interest. 6.1.2 Theory-based inferential methods for \\(\\bar{x}\\) As with the sample proportion, the variability of the sample mean is well described by the mathematical theory given by the Central Limit Theorem. Similar to how we can model the behavior of the sample proportion \\(\\hat{p}\\) using a normal distribution, the sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) can also be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met. However, because of missing information about the inherent variability in the population, a \\(t\\)-distribution is used in place of the standard normal when performing hypothesis test or confidence interval analyses. The sample mean tends to follow a normal distribution centered at the population mean, \\(\\mu\\), when certain conditions are met. Additionally, we can compute a standard error for the sample mean using the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) and the sample size \\(n\\). Central Limit Theorem for the sample mean When we collect a sufficiently large sample of \\(n\\) independent observations from a population with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{x}\\) will be nearly normal with \\[\\begin{align*} &amp;\\text{Mean}=\\mu &amp;&amp;\\text{Standard Error }(SE) = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\end{align*}\\] Before diving into confidence intervals and hypothesis tests using \\(\\bar{x}\\), we first need to cover two topics: When we modeled \\(\\hat{p}\\) using the normal distribution, certain conditions had to be satisfied. The conditions for working with \\(\\bar{x}\\) are a little more complex, and below, we will discuss how to check conditions for inference using a mathematical model. The standard error is dependent on the population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\). However, we rarely know \\(\\sigma\\), and instead we must estimate it. Because this estimation is itself imperfect, we use a new distribution called the \\(t\\)-distribution to fix this problem, which we discuss in Evaluating the two conditions required for modeling \\(\\bar{x}\\) Two conditions are required to apply the Central Limit Theorem for a sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\): Independence. The sample observations must be independent, The most common way to satisfy this condition is when the sample is a simple random sample from the population. If the data come from a random process, analogous to rolling a die, this would also satisfy the independence condition. Normality. When a sample is small, we also require that the sample observations come from a normally distributed population. We can relax this condition more and more for larger and larger sample sizes. This condition is obviously vague, making it difficult to evaluate, so next we introduce a couple rules of thumb to make checking this condition easier. General rule: how to perform the normality check There is no perfect way to check the normality condition, so instead we use two general rules: \\(\\mathbf{n &lt; 30}\\): If the sample size \\(n\\) is less than 30 and there are no clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition. \\(\\mathbf{n \\geq 30}\\): If the sample size \\(n\\) is at least 30 and there are no particularly extreme outliers, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{x}\\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not. In this first course in statistics, you aren’t expected to develop perfect judgement on the normality condition. However, you are expected to be able to handle clear cut cases based on the rules of thumb.92 Consider the following two plots that come from simple random samples from different populations. Their sample sizes are \\(n_1 = 15\\) and \\(n_2 = 50\\). Are the independence and normality conditions met in each case? Each samples is from a simple random sample of its respective population, so the independence condition is satisfied. Let’s next check the normality condition for each using the rule of thumb. The first sample has fewer than 30 observations, so we are watching for any clear outliers. None are present; while there is a small gap in the histogram on the right, this gap is small and 20% of the observations in this small sample are represented in that far right bar of the histogram, so we can hardly call these clear outliers. With no clear outliers, the normality condition is reasonably met. The second sample has a sample size greater than 30 and includes an outlier that appears to be roughly 5 times further from the center of the distribution than the next furthest observation. This is an example of a particularly extreme outlier, so the normality condition would not be satisfied. In practice, it’s typical to also do a mental check to evaluate whether we have reason to believe the underlying population would have moderate skew (if \\(n &lt; 30\\)) or have particularly extreme outliers \\((n \\geq 30)\\) beyond what we observe in the data. For example, consider the number of followers for each individual account on Twitter, and then imagine this distribution. The large majority of accounts have built up a couple thousand followers or fewer, while a relatively tiny fraction have amassed tens of millions of followers, meaning the distribution is extremely skewed. When we know the data come from such an extremely skewed distribution, it takes some effort to understand what sample size is large enough for the normality condition to be satisfied. Introducing the \\(t\\)-distribution In practice, we cannot directly calculate the standard error for \\(\\bar{x}\\) since we do not know the population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\). We encountered a similar issue when computing the standard error for a sample proportion, which relied on the population proportion, \\(p\\). Our solution in the proportion context was to use sample value in place of the population value when computing the standard error. We’ll employ a similar strategy for computing the standard error of \\(\\bar{x}\\), using the sample standard deviation \\(s\\) in place of \\(\\sigma\\): \\[\\begin{align*} SE = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\approx \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\end{align*}\\] This strategy tends to work well when we have a lot of data and can estimate \\(\\sigma\\) using \\(s\\) accurately. However, the estimate is less precise with smaller samples, and this leads to problems when using the normal distribution to model \\(\\bar{x}\\). We’ll find it useful to use a new distribution for inference calculations called the \\(t\\)-distribution. A \\(t\\)-distribution, shown as a solid line in Figure 6.5, has a bell shape. However, its tails are thicker than the normal distribution’s, meaning observations are more likely to fall beyond two standard deviations from the mean than under the normal distribution. The extra thick tails of the \\(t\\)-distribution are exactly the correction needed to resolve the problem of using \\(s\\) in place of \\(\\sigma\\) in the \\(SE\\) calculation. Figure 6.5: Comparison of a \\(t\\)-distribution and a normal distribution. The \\(t\\)-distribution is always centered at zero and has a single parameter: degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom {degrees of freedom (\\(df\\))!\\(t\\)-distribution} describes the precise form of the bell-shaped \\(t\\)-distribution. Several \\(t\\)-distributions are shown in Figure 6.6 in comparison to the normal distribution. In general, we’ll use a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df = n - 1\\) to model the sample mean when the sample size is \\(n\\). That is, when we have more observations, the degrees of freedom will be larger and the \\(t\\)-distribution will look more like the standard normal distribution; when the degrees of freedom is about 30 or more, the \\(t\\)-distribution is nearly indistinguishable from the normal distribution. Figure 6.6: The larger the degrees of freedom, the more closely the \\(t\\)-distribution resembles the standard normal distribution. Degrees of freedom: df The degrees of freedom describes the shape of the \\(t\\)-distribution. The larger the degrees of freedom, the more closely the distribution approximates the normal model. When modeling \\(\\bar{x}\\) using the \\(t\\)-distribution, use \\(df = n - 1\\). The \\(t\\)-distribution allows us greater flexibility than the normal distribution when analyzing numerical data. In practice, it’s common to use statistical software, such as R, Python, or SAS for these analyses. In R, the function used for calculating probabilities under a \\(t\\)-distribution is pt() (which should seem similar to previous R functions, pnorm() and pchisq()). Don’t forget that with the \\(t\\)-distribution, the degrees of freedom must always be specified! No matter the approach you choose, apply your method using the examples below to confirm your working understanding of the \\(t\\)-distribution. What proportion of the \\(t\\)-distribution with 18 degrees of freedom falls below -2.10? Just like a normal probability problem, we first draw the picture in Figure 6.7 and shade the area below -2.10. Using statistical software, we can obtain a precise value: 0.0250. # using pt() to find probability under the $t$-distribution pt(-2.10, df = 18) #&gt; [1] 0.025 Figure 6.7: The \\(t\\)-distribution with 18 degrees of freedom. The area below -2.10 has been shaded. A \\(t\\)-distribution with 20 degrees of freedom is shown in the top panel of Figure 6.8. Estimate the proportion of the distribution falling above 1.65. With a normal distribution, this would correspond to about 0.05, so we should expect the \\(t\\)-distribution to give us a value in this neighborhood. Using statistical software: 0.0573. Figure 6.8: Top: The \\(t\\)-distribution with 20 degrees of freedom, with the area above 1.65 shaded. Bottom: The \\(t\\)-distribution with 2 degrees of freedom, with the area further than 3 units from 0 shaded. A \\(t\\)-distribution with 2 degrees of freedom is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 6.8. Estimate the proportion of the distribution falling more than 3 units from the mean (above or below). With so few degrees of freedom, the \\(t\\)-distribution will give a more notably different value than the normal distribution. Under a normal distribution, the area would be about 0.003 using the 68-95-99.7 rule. For a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df = 2\\), the area in both tails beyond 3 units totals 0.0955. This area is dramatically different than what we obtain from the normal distribution. What proportion of the \\(t\\)-distribution with 19 degrees of freedom falls above -1.79 units? Use your preferred method for finding tail areas.93 One sample \\(t\\)-confidence intervals Let’s get our first taste of applying the \\(t\\)-distribution in the context of an example about the mercury content of dolphin muscle. Elevated mercury concentrations are an important problem for both dolphins and other animals, like humans, who occasionally eat them. Figure 6.9: A Risso’s dolphin. Photo by Mike Baird, www.bairdphotos.com Observed data We will identify a confidence interval for the average mercury content in dolphin muscle using a sample of 19 Risso’s dolphins from the Taiji area in Japan. The data are summarized in Table 6.1. The minimum and maximum observed values can be used to evaluate whether or not there are clear outliers. Table 6.1: Summary of mercury content in the muscle of 19 Risso’s dolphins from the Taiji area. Measurements are in micrograms of mercury per wet gram of muscle (\\(\\mu\\)g/wet g). \\(n\\) \\(\\bar{x}\\) s minimum maximum 19 4.4 2.3 1.7 9.2 Are the independence and normality conditions satisfied for this data set? The observations are a simple random sample, therefore independence is reasonable. The summary statistics in Table 6.1 do not suggest any clear outliers, with all observations are within 2.5 standard deviations of the mean. Based on this evidence, the normality condition seems reasonable. In the normal model, we used \\(z^{\\star}\\) and the standard error to determine the width of a confidence interval. We revise the confidence interval formula slightly when using the \\(t\\)-distribution: \\[\\begin{align*} &amp;\\text{point estimate} \\ \\pm\\ t^{\\star}_{df} \\times SE &amp;&amp;\\to &amp;&amp;\\bar{x} \\ \\pm\\ t^{\\star}_{df} \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\end{align*}\\] Using the summary statistics in Table 6.1, compute the standard error for the average mercury content in the \\(n = 19\\) dolphins. We plug in \\(s\\) and \\(n\\) into the formula: \\(SE = s / \\sqrt{n} = 2.3 / \\sqrt{19} = 0.528\\). The value \\(t^{\\star}_{df}\\) is a cutoff we obtain based on the confidence level and the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df\\) degrees of freedom. That cutoff is found in the same way as with a normal distribution: we find \\(t^{\\star}_{df}\\) such that the fraction of the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df\\) degrees of freedom within a distance \\(t^{\\star}_{df}\\) of 0 matches the confidence level of interest. When \\(n = 19\\), what is the appropriate degrees of freedom? Find \\(t^{\\star}_{df}\\) for this degrees of freedom and the confidence level of 95% The degrees of freedom is easy to calculate: \\(df = n - 1 = 18\\). Using statistical software, we find the cutoff where the upper tail is equal to 2.5%: \\(t^{\\star}_{18} = 2.10\\). The area below -2.10 will also be equal to 2.5%. That is, 95% of the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df = 18\\) lies within 2.10 units of 0. # use qt() to find the t-cutoff (with 95% in the middle) qt(0.025, df = 18) #&gt; [1] -2.1 qt(0.975, df = 18) #&gt; [1] 2.1 Degrees of freedom for a single sample. If the sample has \\(n\\) observations and we are examining a single mean, then we use the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df=n-1\\) degrees of freedom. Compute and interpret the 95% confidence interval for the average mercury content in Risso’s dolphins. We can construct the confidence interval as \\[\\begin{align*} \\bar{x} \\ \\pm\\ t^{\\star}_{18} \\times SE \\quad \\to \\quad 4.4 \\ \\pm\\ 2.10 \\times 0.528 \\quad \\to \\quad (3.29, 5.51) \\end{align*}\\] We are 95% confident the average mercury content of muscles in Risso’s dolphins is between 3.29 and 5.51 \\(\\mu\\)g/wet gram, which is considered extremely high.

Based on a sample of \\(n\\) independent and nearly normal observations, a confidence interval for the population mean is \\[\\begin{align*} &amp;\\text{point estimate} \\ \\pm\\ t^{\\star}_{df} \\times SE &amp;&amp;\\to &amp;&amp;\\bar{x} \\ \\pm\\ t^{\\star}_{df} \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean, \\(t^{\\star}_{df}\\) corresponds to the confidence level and degrees of freedom \\(df\\), and \\(SE\\) is the standard error as estimated by the sample. The FDA’s webpage provides some data on mercury content of fish. Based on a sample of 15 croaker white fish (Pacific), a sample mean and standard deviation were computed as 0.287 and 0.069 ppm (parts per million), respectively. The 15 observations ranged from 0.18 to 0.41 ppm. We will assume these observations are independent. Based on the summary statistics of the data, do you have any objections to the normality condition of the individual observations?94 Estimate the standard error of \\(\\bar{x} = 0.287\\) ppm using the data summaries in the previous Guided Practice. If we are to use the \\(t\\)-distribution to create a 90% confidence interval for the actual mean of the mercury content, identify the degrees of freedom and \\(t^{\\star}_{df}\\). The standard error: \\(SE = \\frac{0.069}{\\sqrt{15}} = 0.0178\\). Degrees of freedom: \\(df = n - 1 = 14\\). Since the goal is a 90% confidence interval, we choose \\(t_{14}^{\\star}\\) so that the two-tail area is 0.1: \\(t^{\\star}_{14} = 1.76\\). # use qt() to find the t-cutoff (with 90% in the middle) qt(0.05, df = 14) #&gt; [1] -1.76 qt(0.95, df = 14) #&gt; [1] 1.76 Using the information and results of the previous Guided Practice and Example, compute a 90% confidence interval for the average mercury content of croaker white fish (Pacific).95 The 90% confidence interval from the previous Guided Practice is 0.256 ppm to 0.318 ppm. Can we say that 90% of croaker white fish (Pacific) have mercury levels between 0.256 and 0.318 ppm?96 One sample \\(t\\)-tests Now that we’ve used the \\(t\\)-distribution for making a confidence intervals for a mean, let’s speed on through to hypothesis tests for the mean. Is the typical US runner getting faster or slower over time? We consider this question in the context of the Cherry Blossom Race, which is a 10-mile race in Washington, DC each spring. The average time for all runners who finished the Cherry Blossom Race in 2006 was 93.29 minutes (93 minutes and about 17 seconds). We want to determine using data from 100 participants in the 2017 Cherry Blossom Race whether runners in this race are getting faster or slower, versus the other possibility that there has been no change. What are appropriate hypotheses for this context?97 The data come from a simple random sample of all participants, so the observations are independent. However, should we be worried about the normality condition? See Figure 6.10 for a histogram of the differences and evaluate if we can move forward.98 Figure 6.10: A histogram of time for the sample Cherry Blossom Race data. When completing a hypothesis test for the one-sample mean, the process is nearly identical to completing a hypothesis test for a single proportion. First, we find the Z score using the observed value, null value, and standard error; however, we call it a T score since we use a \\(t\\)-distribution for calculating the tail area. Then we finding the p-value using the same ideas we used previously: find the one-tail area under the sampling distribution, and double it. With both the independence and normality conditions satisfied, we can proceed with a hypothesis test using the \\(t\\)-distribution. The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the sample of 100 runners from the 2017 Cherry Blossom Race are 97.32 and 16.98 minutes, respectively. Recall that the sample size is 100 and the average run time in 2006 was 93.29 minutes. Find the test statistic and p-value. What is your conclusion? To find the test statistic (T score), we first must determine the standard error: \\[\\begin{align*} SE = 16.98 / \\sqrt{100} = 1.70 \\end{align*}\\] Now we can compute the T score using the sample mean (97.32), null value (98.29), and \\(SE\\): \\[\\begin{align*} T = \\frac{97.32 - 93.29}{1.70} = 2.37 \\end{align*}\\] For \\(df = 100 - 1 = 99\\), we can determine using statistical software (or a \\(t\\)-table, see below) that the one-tail area is 0.01, which we double to get the p-value: 0.02. Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. That is, the data provide strong evidence that the average run time for the Cherry Blossom Run in 2017 is different than the 2006 average. Since the observed value is above the null value and we have rejected the null hypothesis, we would conclude that runners in the race were slower on average in 2017 than in 2006. # using pt() to find the p-value 1 - pt(2.37, df = 99) #&gt; [1] 0.00986 When using a \\(t\\)-distribution, we use a T score (same as Z score). To help us remember to use the \\(t\\)-distribution, we use a \\(T\\) to represent the test statistic, and we often call this a T score. The Z score and T score are computed in the exact same way and are conceptually identical: each represents how many standard errors the observed value is from the null value. 6.2 Paired mean difference Notation. \\(n_{diff}\\) = sample size of differences in paired samples \\(\\hat{x}_{diff}\\) = sample mean of differences in paired samples \\(s_{diff}\\) = sample standard deviation of differences in paired samples \\(\\mu_{diff}\\) = population mean of differences in paired samples \\(\\sigma_{diff}\\) = population standard deviation of differences in paired samples Paired data represent a particular type of experimental structure where the analysis is somewhat akin to a one-sample analysis (see Section 6.1) but has other features that resemble a two-sample analysis (see Section 6.3). As with a two-sample analysis, quantitative measurements are made on each of two different levels of the explanatory variable. However, because the observational unit is paired across the two groups, the two measurements are subtracted such that only the difference is retained. Table 6.2 presents some examples of studies where paired designs were implemented. Table 6.2: Examples of studies where a paired design is used to measure the difference in the measurement over two conditions. Observational unit Comparison groups Measurement Value of interest Car Brand A vs Brand B amount of tire tread after 1,000 miles difference in tread Textbook UCLA vs Amazon price of new text difference in price Individual person Pre-course vs Post-course exam score difference in score Paired data. Two sets of observations are paired if each observation in one set has a special correspondence or connection with exactly one observation in the other data set. 6.2.1 Randomization test for \\(H_0: \\mu_d = 0\\) Consider an experiment done to measure whether tire brand A or tire brand B has longer wear. That is, after 1,000 miles on a car, which brand of tires has more tread, on average? Observed data The observed data represent 25 tread measurements taken on 25 tires of Brand A and 25 tires of Brand B. The study used a total of 25 cars, so on each car, one tire was of Brand A and one was of Brand B. Figure 6.11 presents the observed data. The Brand A manufacturer looks at the box plot below and says: &gt; clearly the tread on Brand A tires is higher, on average, than the tread on Brand B tires after 1,000 miles of driving. The Brand B manufacturer is skeptical and retorts: &gt; but with only 25 cars, it seems that the variability in road conditions (sometimes on tire hits a pothole, etc.) could be what leads to the small difference in average tread amount. We’d like to be able to systematically distinguish between what manufacturer A sees in the plot and what manufacturer B sees in the plot. Fortunately for us, we have an excellent way to simulate the natural variability (from road conditions, etc.) that can lead to tires being worn at different rates. Figure 6.11: Boxplots of the tire tread data and the brand of tire from which the original measurements came. Variability of the statistic A randomization test will identify whether the differences seen in the box plot below could have happened just by chance variability. As before, we will simulate the variability in the study under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. In this study, the null hypothesis is that average tire tread wear is the same across Brand A and Brand B tires. \\(H_0: \\mu_A = \\mu_B\\), the average tread wear is the same for the two tire brands. \\(H_A: \\mu_A \\ne \\mu_B\\), the average tread wear is different across the two tire brands. Figure 6.12 describes how the tread values can be simulated under the null hypothesis. Remember, if the null hypothesis is true, it will not matter which brand is put on which tire because the overall tread wear will be the same across pairs. Figure 6.12: process of randomizing across pairs. After randomizing the tire brand to the tread measurements under the null hypothesis, a new boxplot summarizes the randomized data. Figure 6.13 presents one randomization of the data. Notice how the same two observations are linked by a grey line, but some of the tread values have been randomly assigned to the opposite tire brand than they were originally (while some are still connected to their original tire brands). Figure 6.13: One randomization where the brand is randomly swapped (or not) across the two tread wear measurements from the same car. Figure 6.14 presents yet another randomization of the data. Again, the same observations are linked by a grey line, and some of the tread values have been randomly assigned to the opposite tire brand than they were originally (while some are still connected to their original tire brands). Figure 6.14: An additional randomization where the brand is randomly swapped (or not) across the two tread wear measurements from the same car. Observed statistic vs. null statistics By repeating the randomization process, we can create a distribution of the average of the differences in tire treads, as seen in Figure 6.16. As expected (because the differences were generated under the null hypothesis), the center of the histogram is zero. A line has been drawn at the observed difference which is nowhere near the differences simulated from natural variability by mixing up which the tire received brand A and which received brand B. Because the observed statistic is so far away from the natural variability of the randomized differences, we believe that there is a significant difference between brand A and brand B. Our conclusion is that the extra amount of average tire tread in brand A is due to more than just natural variability: we reject \\(H_0\\) and conclude that \\(\\mu_A &gt; \\mu_B\\). need an actual p-value here, probably shade the tails of the graph, too Figure 6.15: process of randomizing across pairs. Figure 6.16: Histogram of 1000 differences with tire brand randomly assigned across the two observations per pair. 6.2.2 Bootstrap confidence interval for \\(\\mu_d\\) For both the bootstrap and the mathematical models applied to paired data, the analysis is virtually identical to the one-sample approach given in Section 6.1. The key to working with paired data (for bootstrapping and mathematical approaches) is to consider the measurement of interest to be the difference in measured values across the pair of observations. Observed data In an earlier edition of this textbook, we found that Amazon prices were, on average, lower than those of the UCLA Bookstore for UCLA courses in 2010. It’s been several years, and many stores have adapted to the online market, so we wondered, how is the UCLA Bookstore doing today? We sampled 201 UCLA courses. Of those, 68 required books could be found on Amazon. A portion of the data set from these courses is shown in Figure 6.3, where prices are in US dollars. Table 6.3: Four cases of the ucla_textbooks_f18 dataset. subject course_num bookstore_new amazon_new price_diff American Indian Studies M10 48.0 47.5 0.52 Anthropology 2 14.3 13.6 0.71 Arts and Architecture 10 13.5 12.5 0.97 Asian M60W 49.3 55.0 -5.69 Each textbook has two corresponding prices in the data set: one for the UCLA Bookstore and one for Amazon. When two sets of observations have this special correspondence, they are said to be paired. Variability of the statistic Following the example of bootstrapping the one-sample statistic, the observed differences can be bootstrapped in order to understand the variability of the average difference from sample to sample. Figure 6.17: a figure similar to this but with differences in prices (books????) as the unit to bootstrap. In Figure 6.18, two 99% confidence intervals for the difference in the cost of a new book at the UCLA bookstore compared with Amazon have been calculated. The bootstrap percentile interval is computing using the 0.5 percentile and 99.5 percentile bootstrapped differences and is found to be ($ 0.25, $ 7.87). The bootstrap SE interval is found by computing the SE of the bootstrapped differences (\\(s_{diff} = \\$1.64\\)) and the normal multiplier of \\(z^* = 2.58\\). The averaged difference is \\(\\bar{x} = \\$3.58\\). The 99% confidence interval is: $ $3.58 $ 1.64 ($-0.65, $7.81)$. The confidence intervals seem to indicate that the UCLA bookstore price is, on average, higher than the Amazon price. However, if the analysis required a strong degree of certainty (e.g., 99% confidence), and the bootstrap SE interval was most appropriate (given a second course in statistics the nuances of the methods were investigated), the results of which book seller is higher is not well determined. That is, the 99% bootstrap SE interval gives potential for UCLA to be lower, on average, than Amazon (because of the possible negative values for the true mean difference in price). #&gt; # A tibble: 1 x 2 #&gt; lower_ci upper_ci #&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 0.108 8.32 #&gt; # A tibble: 1 x 2 #&gt; lower_ci upper_ci #&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 -0.652 7.82 Figure 6.18: Bootstrap distribution for the average difference in new book price at the UCLA bookstore versus Amazon. 99% confidence intervals are superimposed using blue (bootstrap percentile interval) and green (bootstrap SE interval) lines. 6.2.3 Mathematical model Thinking about the differences as a single observation on an observational unit changes the paired setting into the one-sample setting. The mathematical model for the one-sample case is covered in Section 6.1.2. Observed data To analyze paired data, it is often useful to look at the difference in outcomes of each pair of observations. In the textbook data, we look at the differences in prices, which is represented as the price_difference variable in the data set. Here the differences are taken as \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{UCLA Bookstore price} - \\text{Amazon price} \\end{align*}\\] It is important that we always subtract using a consistent order; here Amazon prices are always subtracted from UCLA prices. The first difference shown in Table 6.3 is computed as \\(47.97 - 47.45 = 0.52\\). Similarly, the second difference is computed as \\(14.26 - 13.55 = 0.71\\), and the third is \\(13.50 - 12.53 = 0.97\\). A histogram of the differences is shown in Figure 6.19. Using differences between paired observations is a common and useful way to analyze paired data. Figure 6.19: Histogram of the difference in price for each book sampled. Variability of the statistic To analyze a paired data set, we simply analyze the differences. We can use the same \\(t\\)-distribution techniques we applied in Section 6.1.2. Table 6.4: Summary statistics for the 68 price differences. \\(n_{diff}\\) \\(\\bar{x}_{diff}\\) \\(s_{diff}\\) 68 3.58 13.4 Set up a hypothesis test to determine whether, on average, there is a difference between Amazon’s price for a book and the UCLA bookstore’s price. Also, check the conditions for whether we can move forward with the test using the \\(t\\)-distribution. We are considering two scenarios: there is no difference or there is some difference in average prices. \\(H_0\\): \\(\\mu_{diff} = 0\\). There is no difference in the average textbook price. \\(H_A\\): \\(\\mu_{diff} \\neq 0\\). There is a difference in average prices. Next, we check the independence and normality conditions. The observations are based on a simple random sample, so independence is reasonable. While there are some outliers, \\(n = 68\\) and none of the outliers are particularly extreme, so the normality of \\(\\bar{x}\\) is satisfied. With these conditions satisfied, we can move forward with the \\(t\\)-distribution. Observed statistic vs. null statistics As mentioned previously, the methods applied to a difference will be identical to the one-sample techniques. Therefore, the full hypothesis test framework is given as an example. Complete the hypothesis test started in the previous Example. To compute the test compute the standard error associated with \\(\\bar{x}_{diff}\\) using the standard deviation of the differences (\\(s_{diff} = 13.42\\)) and the number of differences (\\(n_{diff} = 68\\)): \\[\\begin{align*} SE_{\\bar{x}_{diff}} = \\frac{s_{diff}}{\\sqrt{n_{diff}}} = \\frac{13.42}{\\sqrt{68}} = 1.63 \\end{align*}\\] The test statistic is the T-score of \\(\\bar{x}_{diff}\\) under the null condition that the actual mean difference is 0: \\[\\begin{align*} T = \\frac{\\bar{x}_{diff} - 0} {SE_{x_{diff}}} = \\frac{3.58 - 0}{1.63} = 2.20 \\end{align*}\\] To visualize the p-value, the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{x}_{diff}\\) is drawn as though \\(H_0\\) is true, and the p-value is represented by the two shaded tails in Figure 6.20. The degrees of freedom is \\(df = 68 - 1 = 67\\). Using statistical software, we find the one-tail area of 0.0156. Doubling this area gives the p-value: 0.0312. Because the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. Amazon prices are, on average, lower than the UCLA Bookstore prices for UCLA courses. Figure 6.20: Distribution of \\(\\bar{x}_{diff}\\) under the null hypothesis of no difference. The observed average difference of 2.98 is marked with the shaded areas more extreme than the observed difference given as the p-value. Create a 95% confidence interval for the average price difference between books at the UCLA bookstore and books on Amazon.^[Conditions have already verified and the standard error computed in a previous Example. To find the confidence interval, identify \\(t^{\\star}_{67}\\) using statistical software or the \\(t\\)-table (\\(t^{\\star}_{67} = 2.00)\\), and plug it, the point estimate, and the standard error into the confidence interval formula: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{point estimate} \\ \\pm\\ z^{\\star} \\times SE \\quad\\to\\quad 3.58 \\ \\pm\\ 2.00 \\times 1.63 \\quad\\to\\quad (0.32 6.84) \\end{align*}\\] We are 95% confident that Amazon is, on average, between $0.32 and $6.84 less expensive than the UCLA Bookstore for UCLA course books.] We have strong evidence that Amazon is, on average, less expensive. How should this conclusion affect UCLA student buying habits? Should UCLA students always buy their books on Amazon?^[The average price difference is only mildly useful for this question. Examine the distribution shown in Figure 6.19. There are certainly a handful of cases where Amazon prices are far below the UCLA Bookstore’s, which suggests it is worth checking Amazon (and probably other online sites) before purchasing. However, in many cases the Amazon price is above what the UCLA Bookstore charges, and most of the time the price isn’t that different. Ultimately, if getting a book immediately from the bookstore is notably more convenient, e.g. to get started on reading or homework, it’s likely a good idea to go with the UCLA Bookstore unless the price difference on a specific book happens to be quite large. For reference, this is a very different result from what we (the authors) had seen in a similar data set from 2010. At that time, Amazon prices were almost uniformly lower than those of the UCLA Bookstore’s and by a large margin, making the case to use Amazon over the UCLA Bookstore quite compelling at that time. Now we frequently check multiple websites to find the best price.] 6.3 Difference of two means Notation. \\(n_1\\), \\(n_2\\) = sample sizes of two independent samples \\(\\bar{x}_1\\), \\(\\bar{x}_2\\) = sample means of two independent samples \\(s_1\\), \\(s_2\\) = sample standard deviations of two independent samples \\(\\mu_1\\), \\(\\mu_2\\) = population means of two independent samples \\(\\sigma_1\\), \\(\\sigma_2\\) = population standard deviations of two independent samples In this section we consider a difference in two population means, \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\), under the condition that the data are not paired. Just as with a single sample, we identify conditions to ensure we can use the \\(t\\)-distribution with a point estimate of the difference, \\(\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2\\), and a new standard error formula. The details for working through inferential problems in the two independent means setting are strikingly similar to those applied to the two independent proportions stetting. We first cover a randomization test where the observations are shuffled under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Then we bootstrap the data (with no imposed null hypothesis) to create a confidence interval for the true difference in population means, \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\). The mathematical model, here the \\(t\\)-distribution, is able to describe both the randomization test and the boostrapping as long as the conditions are met. The inferential tools are applied to three different data contexts: determining whether stem cells can improve heart function, exploring the relationship between pregnant women’s smoking habits and birth weights of newborns, and exploring whether there is statistically significant evidence that one variation of an exam is harder than another variation. This section is motivated by questions like “Is there convincing evidence that newborns from mothers who smoke have a different average birth weight than newborns from mothers who don’t smoke?” 6.3.1 Randomization test for \\(H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0\\) An instructor decided to run two slight variations of the same exam. Prior to passing out the exams, she shuffled the exams together to ensure each student received a random version. Summary statistics for how students performed on these two exams are shown in Table 6.5 and plotted in Figure 6.21. Anticipating complaints from students who took Version B, she would like to evaluate whether the difference observed in the groups is so large that it provides convincing evidence that Version B was more difficult (on average) than Version A. Observed data Table 6.5: Summary statistics of scores for each exam version. \\(n\\) \\(\\bar{x}\\) s minimum maximum A 58 75.1 13.9 44 100 B 55 72.0 13.8 38 100 Figure 6.21: Exam scores for students given one of three different exams. Construct hypotheses to evaluate whether the observed difference in sample means, \\(\\bar{x}_A - \\bar{x}_B=3.1\\), is due to chance. We will later evaluate these hypotheses using \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\).99 Before moving on to evaluate the hypotheses in the previous Guided Practice, let’s think carefully about the dataset. Are the observations across the two groups independent? Are there any concerns about outliers?100 Variability of the statistic need to talk about the way to randomize is almost identical to chapter 5 &amp; 6. a new plot will probably help (but again, very similar to 5.7) In Section ??, the variability of the statistic (previously: \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\)) was visualized after shuffling the observations across the two treatment groups many times. The shuffling process implements the null hypothesis model (that there is no effect of the treatment). In the exam example, the null hypothesis is that exam A and exam B are equally difficult, so the average scores across the two tests should be the same. If the exams were equally difficult, due to natural variability, we would sometimes expect students to do slightly better on exam A (\\(\\bar{x}_A &gt; \\bar{x}_B\\)) and sometimes expect students to do slightly better on exam B (\\(\\bar{x}_B &gt; \\bar{x}_A\\)). The question at hand is: does \\(\\bar{x}_A - \\bar{x}_B=3.1\\) indicate that exam A is easier than exam B. Figure 6.22 shows the process of randomizing the exam to the observed exam scores. If the null hypothesis is true, then the score on each exam should represent the true student ability on that material. It shouldn’t matter whether they were given exam A or exam B. By reallocating which student got which exam, we are able to understand how the difference in average exam scores changes due only to natural variability. There is only one iteration of the randomization process in Figure 6.22, leading to one simulated difference in average scores. Figure 6.22: The version of the test (A or B) is randomly allocated to the test scores, under the null assumption that the tests are equally difficult. Building on Figure 6.22, Figure 6.23 shows the values of the simulated statistics \\(\\bar{x}_{1, sim} - \\bar{x}_{2, sim}\\) over 1000 random simulations. We see that, just by chance, the difference in scores can range anywhere from -10 points to +10 points. Figure 6.23: Histogram of differences in means, calculated from 1000 different randomizations of the exam types. Observed statistic vs. null statistics The goal of the randomization test is to assess the observed data, here the statistic of interest is \\(\\bar{x}_A - \\bar{x}_B=3.1\\). The randomization distribution allows us to identify whether a difference of 3.1 points is more than one would expect by natural variability. By plotting the value of 3.1 on Figure 6.24, we can measure how different or similar 3.1 is to the randomized differences which were generated under the null hypothesis. Figure 6.24: Histogram of differences in means, calculated from 1000 different randomizations of the exam types. The observed difference of 3.1 points is plotted as a vertical line, and the area more extreme than 3.1 is shaded to represent the p-value. Approximate the p-value depicted in Figure 6.24, and provide a conclusion in the context of the case study. Using software, we can find the number of shuffled differences in means that are less than the observed difference (of 3.14) is 19 (our of 1000 randomizations). So 10% of the simulations are larger than the observed difference. To get the p-value, we double the proportion of randomized differences which are larger than the observed difference, p-value = 0.2. Previously, we specified that we would use \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\). Since the p-value is larger than \\(\\alpha\\), we do not reject the null hypothesis. That is, the data do not convincingly show that one exam version is more difficult than the other, and the teacher should not be convinced that she should add points to the Version B exam scores. #&gt; # A tibble: 1 x 1 #&gt; p_value #&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 0.1 The large p-value and consistency of \\(\\bar{x}_A - \\bar{x}_B=3.1\\) with the randomized differences leads us to not reject the null hypothesis. Said differently, there is no evidence to think that one of the tests is easier than the other. One might be inclined to conclude that the tests have the same level of difficulty, but that conclusion would be wrong. The hypothesis testing framework is set up only to reject a null claim, it is not set up to validate a null claim. As we concluded, the data are consistent with exams A and B being equally difficult, but the data are also consistent with exam A being 3.1 points “easier” than exam B. The data are not able to adjudicate on whether the exams are equally hard or whether one of them is slightly easier. Indeed, conclusions where the null hypothesis is not rejected often seem unsatisfactory. However, in this case, the teacher and class are probably all relieved that there is no evidence to demonstrate that one of the exams is more difficult than the other. 6.3.2 Bootstrap confidence interval for \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) Does treatment using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) help improve heart function following a heart attack? Table 6.6 contains summary statistics for an experiment to test ESCs in sheep that had a heart attack. Each of these sheep was randomly assigned to the ESC or control group, and the change in their hearts’ pumping capacity was measured in the study. Figure 6.29 provides histograms of the two data sets. A positive value corresponds to increased pumping capacity, which generally suggests a stronger recovery. Our goal will be to identify a 95% confidence interval for the effect of ESCs on the change in heart pumping capacity relative to the control group. Observed data Table 6.6: Summary statistics of the embryonic stem cell study. \\(n\\) \\(\\bar{x}\\) s ESCs 9 3.50 5.17 control 9 -4.33 2.76 The point estimate of the difference in the heart pumping variable is straightforward to find: it is the difference in the sample means. \\[\\begin{align*} \\bar{x}_{esc} - \\bar{x}_{control}\\ =\\ 3.50 - (-4.33)\\ =\\ 7.83 \\end{align*}\\] Variability of the statistic As we saw in Section 5.4.2, we will use bootstrapping to estimate the variability associated with the difference in sample means when taking repeated samples. In a method akin to two proportions, a separate sample is taken with replacement from each group (here ESCs and control), the sample means are calculated, and their difference is taken. The entire process is repeated multiple times to produce a bootstrap distribution of the difference in sample means (without the null hypothesis assumption). Figure 6.26 displays the variability of the differences in means with the 90% percentile and SE CIs super imposed. one we have the whole example, write up a bit about how the two different intervals are constructed (including the calculated value of the SE of the difference in means) with the cars, we can compare two different cities. link each bootstrap sample, create the interval, etc. Figure 6.25: first figure with the ? pop, then sample, then estimate of the pop. need to re-do with cars Figure 6.26: Histogram of differences in means after 1000 bootstrap samples from each of the two groups. The observed difference is plotted as a black vertical line at 7.83. The blue and green lines provide the percentile bootstrap and SE boostrap confidence intervals, respectively, for the difference in true population means. Choose one of the boostrap confidence intervals for the true difference in average pumping capacity, \\(\\mu_{esc} - \\mu_{control}\\). Does the interval show that there is a difference across the two treatments? Because the 90% intervals above do not overlap zero (zero is never one of the bootstrapped differences, 95% or 99% intervals would have given the same conclusion!), we conclude tha the ESC treatment is significantly better with respect to heart pumping capacity than the treatment. Beause the study is a randomized controled experiment, we can conclude that it is the treatment (ESC) whic is causing the change in pumping capacity. 6.3.3 Mathematical model 6.3.3.1 \\(t\\)-test for \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) Observed data A data set called ncbirths represents a random sample of 150 cases of mothers and their newborns in North Carolina over a year. Four cases from this data set are represented in Table 6.7. We are particularly interested in two variables: weight and smoke. The weight variable represents the weights of the newborns and the smoke variable describes which mothers smoked during pregnancy. We would like to know, is there convincing evidence that newborns from mothers who smoke have a different average birth weight than newborns from mothers who don’t smoke? We will use the North Carolina sample to try to answer this question. The smoking group includes 50 cases and the nonsmoking group contains 100 cases. Table 6.7: Four cases from the ncbirths data set. The value NA, shown for the first two entries of the first variable, indicates that piece of data is missing. fage mage mature weeks premie visits marital gained weight lowbirthweight gender habit whitemom NA 13 younger mom 39 full term 10 not married 38 7.63 not low male nonsmoker not white NA 14 younger mom 42 full term 15 not married 20 7.88 not low male nonsmoker not white 19 15 younger mom 37 full term 11 not married 38 6.63 not low female nonsmoker white 21 15 younger mom 41 full term 6 not married 34 8.00 not low male nonsmoker white Set up appropriate hypotheses to evaluate whether there is a relationship between a mother smoking and average birth weight. The null hypothesis represents the case of no difference between the groups. \\(H_0\\): There is no difference in average birth weight for newborns from mothers who did and did not smoke. In statistical notation: \\(\\mu_{n} - \\mu_{s} = 0\\), where \\(\\mu_{n}\\) represents non-smoking mothers and \\(\\mu_s\\) represents mothers who smoked. \\(H_A\\): There is some difference in average newborn weights from mothers who did and did not smoke (\\(\\mu_{n} - \\mu_{s} \\neq 0\\)). Variability of the statistic We check the two conditions necessary to model the difference in sample means using the \\(t\\)-distribution. Because the data come from a simple random sample, the observations are independent, both within and between samples. With both data sets over 30 observations, we inspect the data in Figure 6.27 for any particularly extreme outliers and find none. Since both conditions are satisfied, the difference in sample means may be modeled using a \\(t\\)-distribution. Figure 6.27: The top panel represents birth weights for infants whose mothers smoked. The bottom panel represents the birth weights for infants whose mothers who did not smoke. The summary statistics in Table 6.8 may be useful for this Guided Practice.101 What is the point estimate of the population difference, \\(\\mu_{n} - \\mu_{s}\\)? Compute the standard error of the point estimate from part (a). Table 6.8: Summary statistics for the ncbirths data set. smoker nonsmoker mean 6.78 7.18 st. dev. 1.43 1.60 samp. size 50.00 100.00 Observed statistic vs. null statistics Complete the hypothesis test started in the previous Example and Guided Practice on ncbirths dataset and research question. Use a significance level of \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). For reference, \\(\\bar{x}_{n} - \\bar{x}_{s} = 0.40\\), \\(SE = 0.26\\), and the sample sizes were \\(n_n = 100\\) and \\(n_s = 50\\). We can find the test statistic for this test using the previous information: \\[\\begin{align*} T = \\frac{\\ 0.40 - 0\\ }{0.26} = 1.54 \\end{align*}\\] The p-value is represented by the two shaded tails in Figure 6.28 We find the single tail area using software. We’ll use the smaller of \\(n_n - 1 = 99\\) and \\(n_s - 1 = 49\\) as the degrees of freedom: \\(df = 49\\). The one tail area is 0.065; doubling this value gives the two-tail area and p-value, 0.135. The p-value is larger than the significance value, 0.05, so we do not reject the null hypothesis. There is insufficient evidence to say there is a difference in average birth weight of newborns from North Carolina mothers who did smoke during pregnancy and newborns from North Carolina mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy. Figure 6.28: The mathematical model for the T statistic when the null hypothesis is true. As expected, the curve is centered at zero (the null value). The observered statistic is also plotted with the area more extreme than the observed statistic plotted to indicate the p-value. We’ve seen much research suggesting smoking is harmful during pregnancy, so how could we fail to reject the null hypothesis in the previous Example?102 If we made a Type 2 Error and there is a difference, what could we have done differently in data collection to be more likely to detect the difference?103 Public service announcement: while we have used this relatively small data set as an example, larger data sets show that women who smoke tend to have smaller newborns. In fact, some in the tobacco industry actually had the audacity to tout that as a benefit of smoking: It’s true. The babies born from women who smoke are smaller, but they’re just as healthy as the babies born from women who do not smoke. And some women would prefer having smaller babies. - Joseph Cullman, Philip Morris’ Chairman of the Board on CBS’ Face the Nation, Jan 3, 1971 Fact check: the babies from women who smoke are not actually as healthy as the babies from women who do not smoke.104 \\(t\\) confidence interval for \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) Observed data As with hypothesis testing, for the question of whether we can model the difference using a \\(t\\)-distribution, we’ll need to check new conditions. Like the 2-proportion cases, we will require a more robust version of independence so we are confident the two groups are also independent. Secondly, we also check for normality in each group separately, which in practice is a check for outliers. Using the \\(t\\)-distribution for a difference in means. The \\(t\\)-distribution can be used for inference when working with the standardized difference of two means if Independence (extended). The data are independent within and between the two groups, e.g., the data come from independent random samples or from a randomized experiment. Normality. We check the outliers for each group separately. The standard error may be computed as \\[\\begin{align*} SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}} \\end{align*}\\] The official formula for the degrees of freedom is quite complex and is generally computed using software, so instead you may use the smaller of \\(n_1 - 1\\) and \\(n_2 - 1\\) for the degrees of freedom if software isn’t readily available. Variability of the statistic Can the \\(t\\)-distribution be used to make inference using the point estimate, \\(\\bar{x}_{esc} - \\bar{x}_{control} = 7.83\\)? First, we check for independence. Because the sheep were randomized into the groups, independence within and between groups is satisfied. Figure 6.29 does not reveal any clear outliers in either group. (The ESC group does look a bit more variability, but this is not the same as having clear outliers.) With both conditions met, we can use the \\(t\\)-distribution to model the difference of sample means. Figure 6.29: Histograms for both the embryonic stem cell and control group. Generally, we use statistical software to find the appropriate degrees of freedom, or if software isn’t available, we can use the smaller of \\(n_1 - 1\\) and \\(n_2 - 1\\) for the degrees of freedom, e.g., if using a \\(t\\)-table to find tail areas. For transparency in the Examples and Guided Practice, we’ll use the latter approach for finding \\(df\\); in the case of the ESC example, this means we’ll use \\(df = 8\\). Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the effect of ESCs on the change in heart pumping capacity of sheep after they’ve suffered a heart attack. We will use the sample difference and the standard error that we computed earlier calculations: \\[\\begin{align*} \\bar{x}_{esc} - \\bar{x}_{control} = 7.83 &amp;&amp; SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{5.17^2}{9} + \\frac{2.76^2}{9}} = 1.95 \\end{align*}\\] Using \\(df = 8\\), we can identify the critical value of \\(t^{\\star}_{8} = 2.31\\) for a 95% confidence interval. Finally, we can enter the values into the confidence interval formula: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{point estimate} \\ \\pm\\ t^{\\star} \\times SE \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad 7.83 \\ \\pm\\ 2.31\\times 1.95 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad (3.32, 12.34) \\end{align*}\\] We are 95% confident that embryonic stem cells improve the heart’s pumping function in sheep that have suffered a heart attack by 3.32% to 12.34% . 6.4 Summary of t-procedures So far in this chapter, we have seen the \\(t\\)-distribution applied as the appropriate mathematical model in three distinct settings. Although the three data structures are different, their similarities and differences are worth pointing out. We provide Table 6.9 partly as a mechanism for understanding \\(t\\)-procedures and partly to highlight the extremely common usage of the \\(t\\)-distribution in practice. You will often hear the following three \\(t\\)-procedures referred to as a one sample \\(t\\)-test (\\(t\\)-interval), paired \\(t\\)-test (\\(t\\)-interval), and two sample \\(t\\)-test (\\(t\\)-interval). Table 6.9: Similarities of \\(t\\)-methods across one sample, paired sample, and two independent samples analysis of a numeric response variable. one sample paired sample two indep. samples response variable numeric numeric numeric explanatory variable none binary binary parameter of interest mean: \\(\\mu\\) paired mean diff: \\(\\mu_{diff}\\) diff in means: \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) statistic of interest mean: \\(\\bar{x}\\) paired mean diff: \\(\\bar{x}_{diff}\\) diff in means: \\(\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2\\) standard error \\(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) \\(\\frac{s_{diff}}{\\sqrt{n_{diff}}}\\) \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}\\) degrees of freedom \\(n-1\\) \\(n_{diff} -1\\) \\(\\min(n_1 -1, n_2 - 1)\\) conditions independence, 2. normality or large samples independence, 2. normality or large samples independence, 2. normality or large samples Hypothesis tests. When applying the \\(t\\)-distribution for a hypothesis test, we proceed as follows: Write appropriate hypotheses. Verify conditions for using the \\(t\\)-distribution. One-sample or differences from paired data: the observations (or differences) must be independent and nearly normal. For larger sample sizes, we can relax the nearly normal requirement, e.g., slight skew is okay for sample sizes of 15, moderate skew for sample sizes of 30, and strong skew for sample sizes of 60. For a difference of means when the data are not paired: each sample mean must separately satisfy the one-sample conditions for the \\(t\\)-distribution, and the data in the groups must also be independent. Compute the statistic of interest, the standard error, and the degrees of freedom. For \\(df\\), use \\(n-1\\) for one sample, and for two samples use either statistical software or the smaller of \\(n_1 - 1\\) and \\(n_2 - 1\\). Compute the T-score using the general formula: \\[ T = \\frac{\\mbox{statistic} - \\mbox{null value}}{\\mbox{standard error}} \\] Use the statistical software to find the p-value using the appropriate \\(t\\)-distribution: Sign in \\(H_a\\) is \\(&lt;\\): p-value = area below T-score Sign in \\(H_a\\) is \\(&gt;\\): p-value = area above T-score Sign in \\(H_a\\) is \\(\\neq\\): p-value = 2 \\(\\times\\) area below \\(-|\\mbox{T-score}|\\) Make a conclusion based on the p-value, and write a conclusion in context, in plain language, and in terms of the alternative hypothesis. Confidence intervals. Similarly, the following is how we generally computed a confidence interval using a \\(t\\)-distribution: Verify conditions for using the \\(t\\)-distribution. (See above.) Compute the point estimate of interest, the standard error, the degrees of freedom, and \\(t^{\\star}_{df}\\). Calculate the confidence interval using the general formula: \\[ \\mbox{statistic} \\pm\\ t_{df}^{\\star} SE. \\] Put the conclusions in context and in plain language so even non-data scientists can understand the results. 6.5 R: Inference for quantitative data 6.6 Chapter 6 review 6.6.1 Terms We introduced the following terms in the chapter.

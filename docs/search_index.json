Statistics is an applied field with a wide range of practical applications. You donâ€™t have to be a math guru to learn from interesting, real data. Data are messy, and statistical tools are imperfect. However, when you understand the strengths and weaknesses of these tools, you can use them to learn interesting things about the world. Textbook overview This textbook accompanies the curriculum for STAT 216: Introduction to Statistics at Montana State University. The syllabus and other course information can be found on the course webpage. Detailed learning outcomes for the course can be found here. Introduction to data. Data structures, variables, and basic data collection techniques. Exploratory data analysis. Data visualization and summarization for one and two variables, with a taste of probability. Correlation and regression. Visualizing, describing, and quantifying relationships between two quantitative variables. Multiple regression. Descriptive summaries for quantifying the relationship between many variables. Foundations for inference. Case studies are used to introduce the ideas of statistical inference with randomization and simulations. Inference for categorical data. Inference for one or two proportions using simulation and randomization techniques as well as the normal distribution. Inference for numerical data. Inference for one or two means using simulation and randomization techniques as well as the \\(t\\)-distribution. Inference for regression. Inference for a regression slope or correlation using simulation and randomization techniques as well as the \\(t\\)-distribution. Case studies. A series of case studies assigned weekly in this course. Acknowledgements This resource is largely a derivative of the 1st and 2nd editions of the OpenIntro textbook Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation, without which this effort would not have been possible. The authors would also like to thank the Montana State University Library, who generously funded this project. "]

The principles of simple linear regression lay the foundation for more sophisticated regression models used in a wide range of challenging settings. In this chapter, we explore the idea of “multivariable thinking” – investigating how multiple variables interact with a response variable and with each other – through a few examples. Multiple regression, which introduces the possibility of more than one predictor in a linear model, and logistic regression, a technique for predicting categorical outcomes with two levels, are presented as special topics not covered in this course. 4.1 Gapminder world Gapminder is a “fact tank” that uses publicly available world data to produce data visualizations and teaching resources on global development. We will use an excerpt of their data to explore relationships among world health metrics across countries and regions between the years 1952 and 2007. The gapminder data can be found in the gapminder package. First, let’s look at the relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita (a measure of the wealth of a country) and Life Expectancy (in years) in the year 2007 in Figure 4.1. Figure 4.1: Scatterplot displaying the relationship Life Expectancy and GDP per capita in the year 2007. Note that GDP per capita is plotted on the log scale. What does each dot represent?1 As one might expect, there is a general positive trend between GDP and life expectancy. But does this trend hold across all regions? Let’s explore in Figure 4.2. Figure 4.2: Scatterplot displaying the relationship Life Expectancy and GDP per capita by region in the year 2007. Note that GDP per capita is plotted on the log scale. Regression lines for each continent have been added. Does the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy differ across regions of the world? Yes. Looking at Figure 4.2, the five regression lines have differing slopes, telling us that the estimated change in life expectancy for a given increase in GDP per capita differs across countries. In the Americas and Oceania, life expectancy seems to rise faster with GDP per capita than the other three regions. In this case, we say that GDP per capita interacts with continent in its relationship with life expectancy. Interaction between two explanatory variables. If the relationship between an explanatory variable \\(x\\) and response variable \\(y\\) changes for different levels of another variable \\(z\\), then we say that \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) interact in their relationship with \\(y\\). If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are quantitative, and \\(z\\) is categorical, as in Figure 4.2—where \\(x\\) = GDP per capita, \\(y\\) = life expectancy, and \\(z\\) = continent—then if the different regression lines for each level of \\(z\\) have parallel slopes, we say that \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) do not interact. If the slopes are not parallel, then interaction exists between \\(x\\) and \\(z\\). So far, we’ve explored relationships between three variables, how could we visualize relationships between five variables?2 Let’s add another variable to our plot—population. An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot. Each variable is mapped to an aesthetic. Some possible aesthetics and whether they should be used for quantitative or categorical variables are listed in Table 4.1. Table 4.1: Examples of aesthetics and types of variables mapped to these aesthetics. Aesthetic Variable Position on the x-axis as a number line Quantitative Position on the y-axis as a number line Quantitative Position on the x-axis as categories Categorical Position on the y-axis as categories Categorical Size Quantitative Color Categorical Shape Categorical In Figure 4.3, quantitative variables GDP per capita, life expectancy, and population are mapped to aesthetics: position on the \\(x\\)-axis, position on the \\(y\\)-axis, and population, respectively. The categorical variable Region is mapped to color. Explore individual countries by hovering over the points. Figure 4.3: Scatterplot displaying the relationship between four variables in the year 2007: GDP per capita (x-axis), Life Expectancy (y-axis), Population (size), and Region (color).] How does this pattern compare to what was happening in 1952 (see Figure 4.4)? Figure 4.4: Scatterplot displaying the relationship between four variables in the year 1952: GDP per capita (x-axis), Life Expectancy (y-axis), Population (size), and Region (color). We can visualize relationships among four variables in the plots above (the two quantitative variables on the x- and y-axes and size, and the categorical variable as color), but how could we visualize what happens across time?

If you’re not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions. We are purposefully presenting them in alphabetical order, instead of in order of appearance, so they will be a little more challenging to locate. However you should be able to easily spot them as bolded text. interaction parallel slopes Each observational unit is a single country.↩︎ Each variable can be mapped to some “aesthetic” of the plot. Aesthetics include position on the x-axis, position on the y-axis, size, color, and shape. Since position and size are quantitative, they should be used for quantitative variables. Categorical variables should be mapped to color or shape, though we could also map them to position on the x-axis or y-axis if the axis lists categories rather than a number line.↩︎ "]

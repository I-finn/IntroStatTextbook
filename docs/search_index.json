Statistics is an applied field with a wide range of practical applications. You donâ€™t have to be a math guru to learn from interesting, real data. Data are messy, and statistical tools are imperfect. However, when you understand the strengths and weaknesses of these tools, you can use them to learn interesting things about the world. Textbook overview This textbook accompanies the curriculum for STAT 216: Introduction to Statistics at Montana State University. The syllabus and other course information can be found on the course webpage. Detailed learning outcomes for the course can be found here. Introduction to data. Data structures, variables, and basic data collection techniques. Exploratory data analysis. Data visualization and summarization for one and two variables, with a taste of probability. Correlation and regression. Visualizing, describing, and quantifying relationships between two quantitative variables. Multiple regression. Descriptive summaries for quantifying the relationship between many variables. Foundations for inference. Case studies are used to introduce the ideas of statistical inference with randomization and simulations. Inference for categorical data. Inference for one or two proportions using simulation and randomization techniques as well as the normal distribution. Inference for numerical data. Inference for one or two means using simulation and randomization techniques as well as the \\(t\\)-distribution. Inference for regression. Inference for a regression slope or correlation using simulation and randomization techniques as well as the \\(t\\)-distribution. Case studies. A series of case studies assigned weekly in this course. Statistical computing STAT 216 and this textbook use R and RStudio for statistical computing. In particular, we use the tidyverse collection of packages designed for doing data science. STAT 216 also has its own R package called catstats, which contains all of the functions for running simulation-based inference in this course. Getting RStudio Students have four options for accessing this free software: Download to your own laptop. (Note R and RStudio will not run on iPad, notebooks, or Chromebooks. If you have one of these devices, see the cloud-based option below.) Download and install R. Download and install RStudio Desktop. Install the catstats package. Use RStudio through the RStudio Cloud. This resource allows you to use RStudio through a web browser. It is free for use, but it does limit you to a certain number of project hours per month. Use RStudio through an MSU virtual machine. Use RStudio in an MSU on-campus computer lab. View this tutorial video on installing R and RStudio if you would like additional installation instructions. Installing catstats To use the R functions in the catstats package, you need to first install the remotes package, and then install catstats from Github. In the RStudio console, run the following commands: install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;greenwood-stat/catstats&quot;) If during the installation, it gives you an option to update the more recent versions of packages, type 1 (to choose to install All), then type Yes if it asks if you want to install. You only need to run the installation commands once, but you will need to load the catstats package each time you restart RStudio using the following command: library(catstats) Note that the catstats package will install all of the packages needed to run code in this textbook, so you will not need to load other packages (e.g., openintro) once you load catstats into your R session. Acknowledgements This resource is largely a derivative of the 1st and 2nd editions of the OpenIntro textbook Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation, without which this effort would not have been possible. The authors would also like to thank the Montana State University Library, who generously funded this project. "]

["index.html", "Montana State Introductory Statistics with R Welcome Textbook overview Acknowledgements", " Montana State Introductory Statistics with R Nicole Carnegie, Stacey Hancock, Elijah Meyer, Jade Schmidt, Melinda Yager 2020-07-07 Welcome We hope readers will take away three ideas from this book in addition to forming a foundation of statistical thinking and methods. Statistics is an applied field with a wide range of practical applications. You don’t have to be a math guru to learn from interesting, real data. Data are messy, and statistical tools are imperfect. However, when you understand the strengths and weaknesses of these tools, you can use them to learn interesting things about the~world. Textbook overview Introduction to data. Data structures, variables, summaries, graphics, and basic data collection techniques. Exploratory data analysis. Data visualization and summarisation, with a taste of probability. Correlation and regression. Visualising relationships between many variables and descriptive summaries for quantifying the relationship between two variables. Multiple regression. Descriptive summaries for quantifying the relationship between two variables. Foundations for inference. Case studies are used to introduce the ideas of statistical inference with randomization and simulations. Inference for categorical data. Inference for proportions using simulation and randomization techniques as well as the normal and chi-square distributions. Inference for numerical data. Inference for one or two sample means using simulation and randomization techniques as well as the normal and F distributions. Inference for regression. Extending inference techniques presented thus-far to regression settings. Acknowledgements This resource is largely a derivative of the 1st and 2nd editions of the OpenIntro textbook Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation, without which this effort would not have been possible. The authors would also like to thank the Montana State University Library, who generously funded this project. "],

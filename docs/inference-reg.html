<p>We now bring together ideas of inferential analyses with the descriptive models seen in Chapter <a href="explore-regression.html#explore-regression">6</a>. The setting is now focused on predicting a quantitative response variable, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, from a quantitative explanatory variable, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. We continue to ask questions about the variability of the model from sample to sample. The sampling variability will inform the conclusions about the population that can be drawn.</p>
<p>Many of the inferential ideas are remarkably similar to those covered in previous chapters. The technical conditions for simple linear regression are typically assessed graphically, although independence of observations continues to be of utmost importance.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we bring together the inferential methods used to make claims about a population from information in a sample and the modeling ideas seen in Chapter <a href="explore-regression.html#explore-regression">6</a>.
In particular, we will conduct inference on the slope of a least squares regression line or the correlation to test whether or not there is a relationship between two quantitative variables.
Additionally, we will build confidence intervals which quantify the slope of the linear regression line and correlation between two quantitative variables.</p>
<p>Below we summarize the notation used throughout this chapter.</p>

<p>We start the chapter with a hypothetical example describing the linear relationship between dollars spent advertising for a chain sandwich restaurant and monthly revenue. The hypothetical example serves the purpose of illustrating how a linear model varies from sample to sample. Because we have made up the example and the data (and the entire population), we can take many many samples from the population to visualize the variability. Note that in real life, we always have exactly one sample (that is, one dataset), and through the inference process, we imagine what might have happened had we taken a different sample. The change from sample to sample leads to an understanding of how the single observed dataset is different from the population of values, which is typically the fundamental goal of inference.</p>
<p>Consider the following hypothetical population of all of the sandwich stores of a particular chain seen in Figure <a href="inference-reg.html#fig:sandpop">21.1</a>.
In this made-up world, the CEO actually has all the relevant data, which is why they can plot it here.
The CEO is omniscient and can write down the population model which describes the true population relationship between the advertising dollars and revenue.
There appears to be linear relationship between advertising dollars and revenue (both in $1000).</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>You may remember from Chapter <a href="explore-regression.html#explore-regression">6</a> that the population model is: <span class="math display">\[y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \varepsilon.\]</span></p>
<p>Again, the omniscient CEO (with the full population information) can write down the true population model as: <span class="math display">\[\mbox{expected revenue} = 11.23 + 4.8 \cdot \mbox{advertising}.\]</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, in our scenario, the CEO is not willing to part with the full set of data, but they will allow potential franchise buyers to see a small sample of the data in order to help the potential buyer decide whether or not set up a new franchise.
The CEO is willing to give each potential franchise buyer a random sample of data from 20 stores.</p>
<p>As with any numerical characteristic which describes a subset of the population, the estimated slope of a sample will vary from sample to sample.
Consider the linear model which describes revenue (in $1000) based on advertising dollars (in $1000).</p>
<p>The <strong>least squares regression model</strong> uses the data to find a sample linear fit: <span class="math display">\[\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x,\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> represents the actual revenue, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span> represents the <em>predicted</em> revenue from the model, and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> represents the advertising dollars. A random sample of 20 stores shows a different least square regression line depending on which observations are selected.
A subset of size 20 stores shows a similar positive trend between advertising and revenue (to what we saw in Figure <a href="inference-reg.html#fig:sandpop">21.1</a>, which described the population) despite having fewer observations on the plot.</p>

<p>That is, there is <strong>variability</strong> in the regression line from sample to sample. The concept of the sampling variability is something you’ve seen before, but in this lesson, you will focus on the variability of the line often measured through the variability of a single statistic: <strong>the slope of the line</strong>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:slopes"></span>
<img src="21-regression_files/figure-html/slopes-1.png" alt="If repeated samples of size 20 are taken from the entire population, each linear model will be slightly different. The red line provides the linear fit to the entire population, shown in Figure 21.1." width="90%"><p class="caption">
Figure 21.5: If repeated samples of size 20 are taken from the entire population, each linear model will be slightly different. The red line provides the linear fit to the entire population, shown in Figure <a href="inference-reg.html#fig:sandpop">21.1</a>.
</p>
</div>

<p>You might notice in Figure <a href="inference-reg.html#fig:slopes">21.5</a> that the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span> values given by the lines are much more consistent in the middle of the dataset than at the ends. The reason is that the data itself anchors the lines in such a way that the line must pass through the center of the data cloud. The effect of the fan-shaped lines is that predicted revenue for advertising close to $4,000 will be much more precise than the revenue predictions made for $1,000 or $7,000 of advertising.</p>
<p>The distribution of slopes (for samples of size <span class="math inline">\(n=20\)</span>) can be seen in a histogram, as in Figure <a href="inference-reg.html#fig:sand20lm">21.6</a>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Recall, the example described in this introduction is hypothetical.
That is, we created an entire population in order demonstrate how the slope of a line would vary from sample to sample.
The tools in this textbook are designed to evaluate only one single sample of data.<br>
With actual studies, we do not have repeated samples, so we are not able to use repeated samples to visualize the variability in slopes.
We have seen variability in samples throughout this text, so it should not come as a surprise that different samples will produce different linear models.
However, it is nice to visually consider the linear models produced by different slopes.
Additionally, as with measuring the variability of previous statistics (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2\)</span>), the histogram of the sample statistics can provide information related to inferential considerations.</p>
<p>In the following sections, the distribution (i.e., histogram) of <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> (the estimated slope coefficient) will be constructed in the same three ways that, by now, may be familiar to you.
First (in Section <a href="inference-reg.html#randslope">21.2</a>), the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = 0\)</span> is constructed by randomizing (permuting) the response variable.
Next (in Section <a href="inference-reg.html#bootbeta1">21.3</a>), we can bootstrap the data by taking random samples of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> from the original dataset.
And last (in Section <a href="inference-reg.html#mathslope">21.5</a>), we use mathematical tools to describe the variability using the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution that was first encountered in Section <a href="inference-one-mean.html#one-mean-math">17.3</a>.</p>

<p>Consider the data on Global Crop Yields compiled by <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/crop-yields">Our World in Data</a> and presented as part of the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/trunk/data/2020/2020-09-01">TidyTuesday</a> series seen in Figure <a href="inference-reg.html#fig:allcrops">21.7</a>. The scientific research interest at hand will be in determining the linear relationship between wheat yield (for a country-year) and other crop yields. The dataset is quite rich and deserves exploring, but for this example, we will focus only on the annual crop yield in the United States.</p>

<p>As you have seen previously, statistical inference typically relies on setting a null hypothesis which is hoped to be subsequently rejected. In the linear model setting, we might hope to have a linear relationship between <code>maize</code> and <code>wheat</code> in settings where <code>maize</code> production is known and <code>wheat</code> production needs to be predicted.</p>
<p>The relevant hypotheses for the linear model setting can be written in terms of the population slope parameter. Here the population refers to a larger set of years where <code>maize</code> and <code>wheat</code> are both grown in the US.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(H_0: \beta_1= 0\)</span>, there is no linear relationship between <code>wheat</code> and <code>maize</code>.<br>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(H_A: \beta_1 \ne 0\)</span>, there is some linear relationship between <code>wheat</code> and <code>maize</code>.</li>

<p>Recall that for the randomization test, we shuffle one variable to eliminate any existing relationship between the variables. That is, we set the null hypothesis to be true, and we measure the natural variability in the data due to sampling but <strong>not</strong> due to variables being correlated. Figure <a href="inference-reg.html#fig:permwheatScatter">21.8</a> shows the observed data and a scatterplot of one permutation of the <code>wheat</code> variable. The careful observer can see that each of the observed the values for <code>wheat</code> (and for <code>maize</code>) exist in both the original data plot as well as the permuted <code>wheat</code> plot, but the given <code>wheat</code> and <code>maize</code> yields are no longer matched for a given year. That is, each <code>wheat</code> yield is randomly assigned to a new <code>maize</code> yield.</p>

<p>By repeatedly permuting the response variable, any pattern in the linear model that is observed is due only to random chance (and not an underlying relationship). The randomization test compares the slopes calculated from the permuted response variable with the observed slope. If the observed slope is inconsistent with the slopes from permuting, we can conclude that there is some underlying relationship (and that the slope is not merely due to random chance).</p>

<p>After permuting the data, the least squares estimate of the line can be computed. Repeated permutations and slope calculations describe the variability in the line (i.e., in the slope) due only to the natural variability and not due to a relationship between <code>wheat</code> and <code>maize</code>.

<p>As you can see, sometimes the slope of the permuted data is positive, sometimes it is negative.

<p>As we can see from Figure <a href="inference-reg.html#fig:nulldistCrop">21.10</a>, a slope estimate as extreme as the observed slope estimate (the red line) never happened in many repeated permutations of the <code>wheat</code> variable.
That is, if indeed there were no linear relationship between <code>wheat</code> and <code>maize</code>, the natural variability of the slopes would produce estimates between approximately -0.1 and +0.1.
Therefore, we believe that the slope observed on the original data is not just due to natural variability and indeed, there is a linear relationship between wheat and maize crop yield (in tonnes per hectare) in the US.</p>

If the dot is resampled, both the <code>wheat</code> and the <code>peas</code> measurement are observed.

We can see that a 95% bootstrap percentile interval for the true population slope is given by (0.061, 0.52).
We are 95% confident that for the model describing the population of crops of <code>peas</code> and <code>wheat</code>, a one ton per hectare increase in <code>peas</code> yield will be associated with an increase in predicted average <code>wheat</code> yield of between 0.061 and 0.52 tonnes per hectare.</p>

</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Elections for members of the United States House of Representatives
occur every two years, coinciding every four years with the U.S.
Presidential election. The set of House elections occurring during the
middle of a Presidential term are called midterm elections. In America’s two-party
system (the vast majority of House members through history have been either Republicans or Democrats), one political theory suggests the higher the unemployment rate,
the worse the President’s party will do in the midterm elections. In 2020, there were 232 Democrats, 198 Republicans, and 1 Libertarian in the House.</p>
<p>To assess the validity of this claim, we can compile historical data and
look for a connection. We consider every midterm election from 1898 to
2018, with the exception of those elections during the Great Depression.
The House of Representatives is made up of 435 voting members. Figure <a href="inference-reg.html#fig:unemploymentAndChangeInHouse">21.15</a> shows these data and the
least-squares regression line:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
&amp;\text{predicted % change in House seats for President's party}  \\
&amp;\qquad\qquad= -7.36 - 0.89 \times \text{(unemployment rate)}\end{aligned}\]</span>
We consider the percent change in the number of seats of the President’s
party (e.g., percent change in the number of seats for Republicans in
2018) against the unemployment rate.</p>
<div class="guidedpractice">

<p>Examining the data, there are no clear deviations from linearity or substantial outliers (see Section <a href="inference-reg.html#tech-cond-linmod">21.6</a> for a discussion on using residuals to visualize how well a linear model fits the data).

That is, in many situations, there is no “right” answer. As you do more and more analyses on your own, you will come to recognize the nuanced understanding which is needed for a particular dataset. In terms of the Great Depression, we will provide two contrasting considerations.
Each of these points would have very high leverage on any
least-squares regression line, and years with such high
unemployment may not help us understand what would happen
in other years where the unemployment is only modestly high.
On the other hand, these are exceptional cases, and we would

<p>There is a negative slope in the line shown in Figure <a href="inference-reg.html#fig:unemploymentAndChangeInHouse">21.15</a>. However, this slope (and the
y-intercept) are only estimates of the parameter values. We might
wonder, is this convincing evidence that the “true” linear model has a
negative slope? That is, do the data provide strong evidence that the
political theory is accurate, where the unemployment rate is a useful
predictor of the midterm election? We can frame this investigation into
a statistical hypothesis test:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = 0\)</span>. The true linear model has a zero slope.<br>

<p>To assess the hypotheses, we identify a standard error for the estimate, compute an appropriate test statistic, and identify the p-value.</p>

higher unemployment rate has a negative correlation with percent of seats lost in the house. In other words, we do not have significant evidence for the political theory that the higher the unemployment rate, the worse the President’s party will do in the midterm elections.</p>

<p>As the final step in a mathematical hypothesis test for the slope, we use the information provided to make a conclusion about whether or not the data could have come from a population where the true slope was zero (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = 0\)</span>). Before evaluating the formal hypothesis claim, sometimes it is important to check your intuition.

<p>Elmhurst College in Illinois released anonymized data for family income and financial support provided by the school for Elmhurst’s first-year students in 2011.

statistically significantly different from zero? That is, do you think a
formal hypothesis test would reject the claim that the true slope of the

<p>While the relationship between the variables is not perfect, there is an evident decreasing trend in the data.

</h2>
<p>In the previous sections, we used randomization and bootstrapping to perform inference when the mathematical model was not valid due to violations of the technical conditions. In this section, we’ll provide details for when the mathematical model is appropriate and a discussion of technical conditions needed for the randomization and bootstrapping procedures.</p>
<div id="what-are-the-technical-conditions" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>What are the technical conditions?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-are-the-technical-conditions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>When fitting a least squares line, we generally require</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Linearity.</strong> The data should show a linear trend. If there is a nonlinear trend
(e.g., first panel of Figure <a href="inference-reg.html#fig:whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel">21.17</a>, an advanced regression
method from another book or later course should be applied.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Independent observations.</strong> Be cautious about applying regression to data, which are sequential
observations in time such as a stock price each day. Such data may
have an underlying structure that should be considered in a model
and analysis. An example of a data set where successive observations
are not independent is shown in the fourth panel of
Figure <a href="inference-reg.html#fig:whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel">21.17</a>. There are also other
instances where correlations within the data are important, such as the paired data described in Section <a href="inference-paired-means.html#inference-paired-means">18</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nearly normal residuals.</strong> Generally, the residuals must be nearly normal. When this condition
is found to be unreasonable, it is usually because of outliers or
concerns about influential points, which were discussed in
Section <a href="explore-regression.html#outliers-in-regression">6.3</a>. An example of a
residual that would be a potentially concern is shown in
Figure <a href="inference-reg.html#fig:whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel">21.17</a>, where one observation is
clearly much further from the regression line than the others.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Constant or equal variability (variance).</strong> The variability of points around the least squares line remains
roughly constant. An example of non-constant variability is shown in
the third panel of
Figure <a href="inference-reg.html#fig:whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel">21.17</a>, which represents the
most common pattern observed when this condition fails: the
variability of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is larger when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is larger.</p></li>

<h4>Why do we need technical conditions?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-do-we-need-technical-conditions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>As with other inferential techniques we have covered in this text, if the technical conditions above don’t hold, then it is not possible to make concluding claims about the population.
That is, without the technical conditions, the T-score (or Z-score) will not have the assumed t-distribution (or standard normal Z distribution).
That said, it is almost always impossible to check the conditions precisely, so we look for large deviations from the conditions.
If there are large deviations, we will be unable to trust the calculated p-value or the endpoints of the resulting confidence interval.</p>

<div id="linearity" class="section level3" number="21.6.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">21.6.1</span> <strong>L</strong>inearity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#linearity"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The linearity condition is among the most important if your goal is to understand a linear model between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.
For example, the value of the slope will not be at all meaningful if the true relationship between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is quadratic.
Not only should we be cautious about the inference, but the model <em>itself</em> is also not an accurate portrayal of the relationship between the variables. An extended discussion on the different methods for modeling functional forms other than linear is outside the scope of this text.</p>
</div>
<div id="independence" class="section level3" number="21.6.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">21.6.2</span> <strong>I</strong>ndependence<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#independence"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The technical condition describing the independence of the observations is often the most crucial but also the most difficult to diagnose. It is also extremely difficult to gather a dataset which is a true random sample from the population of interest. (Note: a true randomized experiment from a fixed set of individuals is much easier to implement, and indeed, randomized experiments are done in most medical studies these days.)</p>
<p>Dependent observations can bias results in ways that produce fundamentally flawed analyses. That is, if you hang out at the gym measuring height and weight, your linear model is surely not a representation of all students at your university. At best it is a model describing students who use the gym (but also who are willing to talk to you, that use the gym at the times you were there measuring, etc.).</p>
<p>In lieu of trying to answer whether or not your observations are a true random sample, you might instead focus on whether or not you believe your observations are representative of the populations.
Humans are notoriously bad at implementing random procedures, so you should be wary of any process that used human intuition to balance the data with respect to, for example, the demographics of the individuals in the sample.</p>
</div>
<div id="normality" class="section level3" number="21.6.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">21.6.3</span> <strong>N</strong>ormality<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#normality"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The normality condition requires that points vary symmetrically around the line, spreading out in a bell-shaped fashion. You should consider the “bell” of the normal distribution as sitting on top of the line (coming off the paper in a 3-D sense) so as to indicate that the points are dense close to the line and disperse gradually as they get farther from the line.</p>
<p>The normality condition is less important than linearity or independence for a few reasons.
First, the linear model fit with least squares will still be an unbiased estimate of the true population model.
However, the standard errors associated with variability of the line will not be well estimated.
Fortunately the Central Limit Theorem tells us that most of the inferential analyses (e.g., standard errors, p-values, confidence intervals) done using the mathematical model will still hold (even if the data are not normally distributed around the line) as long as the sample size is large enough.</p>
<p>One analysis method that <em>does</em> require normality, regardless of sample size, is creating intervals which predict the response of individual outcomes at a given <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> value, using the linear model, a topic covered in later courses.
On additional reason to worry slightly less about normality is that neither the randomization test nor the bootstrapping procedures require the data to be normal around the line.</p>
</div>
<div id="equal-variability" class="section level3" number="21.6.4">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">21.6.4</span> <strong>E</strong>qual variability<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#equal-variability"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>As with normality, the equal variability condition (that points are spread out in similar ways around the line for all values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>) will not cause problems for the estimate of the linear model, for a randomization test, or for a bootstrap confidence interval.
However, data that exhibit non-equal variance across the range of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-values will have the potential to seriously mis-estimate the variability of the slope which will have consequences for the inference results (i.e., hypothesis tests and confidence intervals).</p>
<p>When the equal variability condition is violated and a theory-based analysis (e.g., p-value from T-score) is needed, there are existing methods which can easily handle the unequal variance (e.g., weighted least squares analysis), but these are covered in a later course.</p>

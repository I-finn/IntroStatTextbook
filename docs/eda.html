This chapter focuses on the mechanics and construction of summary statistics and graphs.
We use statistical software for generating the summaries and graphs presented in this chapter and book.
However, since this might be your first exposure to these concepts, we take our time in this chapter to detail how to create them.
Mastery of the content presented in this chapter will be crucial for understanding the methods and techniques introduced in rest of the book.

</h2>
<p>In this section, we will introduce tables and other basic tools for organizing and analyzing categorical data that are used throughout this book. Table <a href="eda.html#tab:emailDF">2.1</a> displays the first six rows of the <code>email</code> data set containing information on 3,921 emails sent to David Diez’s Gmail account (one of the authors of the <em>OpenIntro</em> textbooks). In this section we will examine whether the presence of numbers, small or large, in an email provides any useful value in classifying email as spam or not spam.
Descriptions of all five email variables are given in Table <a href="eda.html#tab:emailVariables">2.2</a>.</p>

<div class="data">
The <code>email</code> data can be found in the <a href="http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/index.html">openintro</a> package.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt; data set found in the &lt;code&gt;openintro&lt;/code&gt; package defines the variable &lt;code&gt;spam&lt;/code&gt; as 0 (not spam) or 1 (spam), and &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; as 0 (not HTML) or 1 (HTML). When variables are defined in this way—coded as the numbers 0 and 1 rather than the category names—they are called &lt;strong&gt;indicator variables&lt;/strong&gt;* or &lt;strong&gt;dummy variables&lt;/strong&gt;. In this section of the textbook, we have re-coded &lt;code&gt;spam&lt;/code&gt; to be the variable &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, which takes on values “not spam” or “spam”, and we have re-coded the variable &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; to take on values “not HTML” or “HTML”.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a>

<p>Table <a href="eda.html#tab:emailTable">2.4</a> summarizes two variables:
<code>type</code> (spam or not spam) and <code>number</code>. A table that summarizes data for two categorical variables
in this way is called a <strong>contingency table</strong> or <strong>two-way table</strong>.
Each value in the table represents the number of times, or <strong>frequency</strong>
a particular combination of variable outcomes occurred.
For example, the value 149 corresponds to the number of emails
in the data set that are spam <em>and</em> had no number listed in the email.
Row and column totals are also included.
The <strong>row totals</strong> provide the total counts across each row
(e.g., <span class="math inline">\(149 + 168 + 50 = 367\)</span>), and <strong>column totals</strong> are total
counts down each column.</p>
<p>In this textbook, we generally take the convention of putting the categories of the explanatory variable as the columns and the categories of the response variable as the rows (if there exists and explanatory-response relationship between the two variables).</p>

<p>We would like to examine whether the presence of numbers, small or large, in an email provides any useful value in classifying email as spam or not spam—that is, is there an <strong>association</strong> between the variables <code>number</code> and <code>type</code>?</p>

<div class="guidedpractice">
To determine if a relationship exists between whether an email is spam or not, and whether the email has no numbers, a small number, or a big number, why isn’t it helpful to compare the <em>number</em> of spam emails across the <code>number</code> categories?<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Since the sample sizes in the three &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; categories differ (549 emails with no numbers; 2827 emails with a small number; 545 emails with a big number), we need to compare the &lt;em&gt;proportion&lt;/em&gt; of spam emails across categories rather than the count.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a>
</div>
<p>The proportion of emails that were classified as spam in the data set is <span class="math inline">\(3554/3921 = 0.906\)</span>, or about 91%. Let’s compare this <strong>unconditional proportion</strong> to the <strong>conditional proportions</strong> of spam within each <code>number</code> category: <span class="math inline">\(400/549 = 73\)</span>% of emails with no numbers are spam; <span class="math inline">\(2659/2827 = 94\)</span>% of emails with small numbers are spam; and <span class="math inline">\(495/545 = 91\)</span>% of emails with big numbers are spam. Since these three conditional proportions differ, we say the variables <code>number</code> and <code>type</code> are <em>associated</em> in this data set. Note that some differ from the overall, or unconditional, proportion of spam emails in the data set—91%.</p>

<div class="onebox">
<p><strong>Association between two categorical variables.</strong></p>
<p>An <strong>unconditional</strong> proportion is a proportion measured out of the total sample size. A <strong>conditional</strong> proportion is a proportion measured out of a subgroup in the sample.</p>
If the conditional proportions of a particular outcome (e.g., spam email) within levels of a categorical variable (e.g., whether no number, a small number, or a big number appears in the email) differ across levels, we say those two variables are <strong>associated</strong>. We can also determine if two categorical variables are associated by checking if any of the conditional proportions of the outcome within categories differ from the overall, or <strong>unconditional</strong> proportion.
</div>
<div id="row-and-column-proportions" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Row and column proportions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#row-and-column-proportions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Conditional proportions that condition on a row category are called <strong>row proportions</strong>; conditional proportions that condition on a column category
are called <strong>column proportions</strong>.</p>
<p>Table <a href="eda.html#tab:rowPropSpamNumber">2.5</a> shows the row proportions for Table <a href="eda.html#tab:emailTable">2.4</a>. The row proportions are computed as the counts divided by their row totals. The value 149 at the intersection of <code>type</code> and <code>none</code> is replaced by <span class="math inline">\(149/367=0.406\)</span>, i.e., 149 divided by its row total, 367. So what does 0.406 represent? It corresponds to the conditional proportion of spam emails in the sample that do not have any numbers.</p>

<p>A contingency table of the column proportions is computed in a similar way, where each column proportion is computed as the count divided by the corresponding column total. Table <a href="eda.html#tab:colPropSpamNumber">2.6</a> shows such a table, and here the value 0.271 indicates that 27.1% of emails with no numbers were spam. This rate of spam is much higher than emails with only small numbers (5.9%) or big numbers (9.2%). Because these spam rates vary between the three levels of <code>number</code> (<code>none</code>, <code>small</code>, <code>big</code>), this provides evidence that the <code>spam</code> and <code>number</code> variables are associated in this data set.</p>

<p>The previous Example points out that row and column proportions are not equivalent. Before settling on one form for a table, it is important to consider each to ensure that the most useful table is constructed.</p>

<h4>Sample proportions and population proportions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sample-proportions-and-population-proportions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>In the field of statistics, summary measures that summarize a sample of data are called <strong>statistics</strong>. Numbers that summarize an entire population are called <strong>parameters</strong>. You can remember
this distinction by looking at the first letter of each term:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>S</em></strong>tatistics summarize <strong><em>S</em></strong>amples.<br><strong><em>P</em></strong>arameters summarize <strong><em>P</em></strong>opulations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proportions calculated from a sample of data are denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>.
In our example, we were interested in the proportion of spam emails in our data set, so we could denote this by <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = 0.91\)</span>. If there are different groups we want to summarize with a proportion, we can add subscripts: <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{none} = 0.73\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{small} = 0.94\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{big} = 0.91\)</span>. Each of these values is a statistic since it is computed from a sample of data.</p>
<p>These 3921 emails were a sample from a larger group of emails—all emails that are sent to David Diez, either in the past or in the future. This larger group of emails is the population. There is some unknown value for the proportion of <em>all</em> emails in the population that would be classified as spam, which we denote by <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. Similarly, there are unknown values for the proportion of all emails with no numbers in the population that would be classified as spam, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{none}\)</span>. Each of these unknown values are called parameters.</p>
<p>We typically use Roman letters to symbolize statistics (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>), and Greek letters to symbolize parameters (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>).
Since we rarely can measure the entire population, and thus rarely know
the actual parameter values, we like to say, “We don’t know Greek,
and we don’t know parameters!”</p>

<p>A bar plot is a common way to display a single categorical variable. The left panel of Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:emailNumberBarPlot">2.1</a> shows a <strong>bar plot</strong> for the <code>number</code> variable.
In the right panel, the counts are converted into proportions (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(549/3921=0.140\)</span> for <code>none</code>).</p>

</div>
<p>Bar plots are also used to display the relationship between two categorical variables.
When the bars are stacked such that each bar totals 100% and is segmented by
another categorical variable, it is called a <strong>segmented bar plot</strong>.</p>
<p>A segmented bar plot is a graphical display of contingency table information. For example, segmented bar plots representing Table <a href="eda.html#tab:colPropSpamNumber">2.6</a> is shown in Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:emailSpamNumberSegBar">2.2</a>, where we have first created a non-standardized segmented bar plot using the <code>number</code> variable and then separated each group by the levels of <code>type</code>. The standardized segmented bar plot using the column proportions of Table <a href="eda.html#tab:colPropSpamNumber">2.6</a> is a helpful visualization of the fraction of spam emails in each level of <code>number</code>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

</p>
</div>
<p>Since the proportion of spam changes across the groups in Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:emailSpamNumberSegBar">2.2</a> (seen in plot (b)), we can conclude the variables are dependent, which is something we were also able to discern using the column proportions in Table <a href="eda.html#tab:colPropSpamNumber">2.6</a>. Because both the <code>none</code> and <code>big</code> groups have relatively few observations compared to the <code>small</code> group, the association is more difficult to see in plot (a) of Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:emailSpamNumberSegBar">2.2</a>.</p>
<p>In some other cases, a segmented bar plot that is not standardized will be more useful in communicating important information. Before settling on a particular segmented bar plot, create standardized and non-standardized forms and decide which is more effective at communicating features of the data.</p>
<div id="mosaic-plots" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Mosaic plots<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mosaic-plots"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>A <strong>mosaic plot</strong> is a graphical display of contingency table information that is similar to a bar plot for one variable or a segmented bar plot when using two variables. Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:emailNumberMosaic">2.3</a> plot (a) shows a mosaic plot for the <code>number</code> variable. Each column represents a level of <code>number</code>, and the column widths correspond to the proportion of emails of each number type. For instance, there are fewer emails with no numbers than emails with only small numbers, so the no number email column is slimmer. In general, mosaic plots use box <em>areas</em> to represent the number of observations.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span id="fig:emailNumberMosaic"></span>

</p>
</div>
<p>This one-variable mosaic plot is further divided into pieces in Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:emailNumberMosaic">2.3</a> plot (b) using the <code>type</code> variable. Each column is split proportionally according to the fraction of emails that were spam in each number category. For example, the second column, representing emails with only small numbers, was divided into emails that were spam (lower) and not spam (upper).
As another example, the bottom of the third column represents spam emails that had big numbers, and the upper part of the third column represents regular emails that had big numbers. We can again use this plot to see that the <code>type</code> and <code>number</code> variables are associated since some columns are divided in different vertical locations than others, which was the same technique used for checking an association in the standardized version of the segmented bar plot.</p>

<p>While pie charts are well known, they are not typically as useful as other charts in a data analysis. A <strong>pie chart</strong> is shown in Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:emailNumberPieChart">2.4</a> alongside a bar plot. It is generally more difficult to compare group sizes in a pie chart (comparing angles) than in a bar plot (comparing heights), especially when categories have nearly identical counts or proportions. In the case of the <code>none</code> and <code>big</code> categories, the difference is so slight you may be unable to distinguish any difference in group sizes for either plot!</p>

</div>
<p>Overall, a lower percentage of African American defendants received the death penalty than Caucasian defendants (8% compared to 11%). Given studies have shown racial bias in sentencing, this may be surprising. Let’s look at the data more closely.</p>

<div class="guidedpractice">
Since these are <em>observational data</em>, confounding variables are most likely present.

What confounding variables could be present?<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;The confounding variable we will consider here is race of the victim.

</div>
<p>If we compare Figures <a href="eda.html#fig:DPbarplot">2.6</a> and <a href="eda.html#fig:DPbarplot2">2.7</a>, we see that the direction of the association between the race of the defendant and the sentence is <em>reversed</em> if we subgroup by the race of the victim. Overall, a larger proportion of Caucasians were sentenced to the death penalty than African Americans. However, when we only compare cases with the same victim’s race, a larger proportion of African Americans were sentenced to the death penalty than Caucasians!</p>
<p>How did this happen? The answer has to do with the race of the victim being a confounding variable. Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:DPconfound">2.8</a> shows two segmented barplots examining the relationship between the race of the victim and the sentence (the response variable), and the relationship between the race of the victim and the race of the defendant (the explanatory variable). We see that the race of the victim is associated with both the response and the explanatory variables: defendants are more likely to involve a victim of the same race, and cases with African American victims are less likely to result in the death penalty.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Thus, the extremely low chance of a homicide case resulting in the death penalty for African Americans combined with the fact that most cases with African American defendants also had an African American victim results in an overall lower rate of death penalty sentences for African American defendants than for Caucasian defendants. The overall results in Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:DPbarplot">2.6</a> and the results in each subgroup of Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:DPbarplot2">2.7</a> are both valid—they are not the result of any “bad statistics”—but they suggest opposite conclusions.

<p>A <strong>random process</strong> is one in which the outcome is unpredictable. We encounter random processes every day: will it rain today? how many minutes will pass until receiving your next text message? will the Seahawks win the Super Bowl? Though the outcome of one particular random process is unpredictable, if we observe the process many many times, the pattern of outcomes, or its probability distribution, can often be modeled mathematically. Though there are several philosophical definitions of probability, we will use the “frequentist” definition of probability—a long-run relative frequency.</p>

<div class="onebox">
<p><strong>Probability.</strong></p>
The <strong>probability</strong> of an event is the long-run proportion of times the event would occur if the random process were repeated indefinitely (under identical conditions).
</div>
<p>Consider the simple example of flipping a fair coin once. What is the probability the coin lands on heads. From its physical properties, we assume the probability of heads is 0.5, but let’s use simulation to examine the probability. Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:coinflip">2.9</a> shows the long-run proportion of times a simulated coin flip lands on heads on the y-axis, and the number of tosses on the x-axis. Notice how the long-run proportion starts converging to 0.5 as the number of tosses increases.</p>

<p>We can solve many real-life probability problems without using any equations by creating a <strong>hypothetical two-way table</strong> of the scenario. This tool is best demonstrated by an example.</p>

You have a Bobcat parking permit. From past experience, you know that there is a 20% chance of finding an open parking spot in Lot 6 by Animal Bioscience. Otherwise, you have to park in Lot 18 by graduate housing. If you find a spot in Lot 6, you only have a 5% chance of being late to class. However, if you have to park in Lot 18, you have a 15% chance of being late to class. What is the probability that you will be late to class this Monday?</p>
<hr>
<p>There are two random variables in this scenario: whether you park in Lot 6 or Lot 18, and whether or not you are late to class. Since we know probability is a long-run relative frequency, let’s imagine 1000 hypothetical Mondays, and fill in a contingency table with the frequencies we’d expect in each cell.</p>

<p>Carefully read how each of the probabilities is described in the Guided Practice—note the subtle difference between “the probability of being late to class, <em>given</em> that you parked in Lot 18” (<span class="math inline">\(120/800 = 0.15\)</span>) and “the probability of parking in Lot 18, given that you were late to class” (<span class="math inline">\(120/130 = 0.923\)</span>). When we are given extra information, this is called a <strong>conditional probability</strong>, and the denominator in the probability calculation is a row total (e.g., 800) or column total (e.g., 130) rather than the overall total in the hypothetical two-way table.</p>

</h3>
<p>For ease of translating probability problems into calculations, let’s define some notation. We will denote “<strong>events</strong>” (e.g., being late to class) by upper case letters near the beginning of the alphabet, e.g., <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. The <strong>probability of an event</strong> <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> will be denoted by <span class="math inline">\(P(A)\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(P(A)\)</span> is a number between 0 and 1. The event that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> does <em>not</em> happen is called the <em>complement</em> of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(P(A^C)\)</span>. Sometimes we have additional information that we would like to condition on, and we denote the <strong>conditional probability of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> <em>given</em> <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span></strong> by <span class="math inline">\(P(A | B)\)</span>—the probability that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> happens given that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has already happened.</p>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:unlabeled-div-7" class="example"><strong>Example 2.2  </strong></span>In our coin flip example, we could let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be the event that the coin lands on heads.

We could flip the coin twice and let <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> be the event that the first flip lands on heads, and <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> be the event that the second flip lands on heads. Since the coin does not remember its last flip, if the first flip lands on heads, the second flip still has a 50% chance of landing on heads. That is, <span class="math inline">\(P(H_2 | H_1) = 0.5\)</span>.

</h3>
<p>Medical diagnostic tests for diseases spend years in development. Through clinical trials, developers of the diagnostic test are able to determine two important properties of the test:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>sensitivity</strong> of a diagnostic test is the probability the test yields a positive result, given the individual has the disease. In other words, what proportion of the diseased population would test positive?</li>
<li>The <strong>specificity</strong> of the diagnostic test is the probability the test yields a negative result, given the individual does not have the disease. That is, what proportion of the non-diseased population would test negative?</li>
</ul>
<p>A good diagnostic test has very high (near 100%) sensitivity and specificity. However, even for a near-perfect test, the probability that you have the disease given you test positive could still be quite low. To investigate this counter-intuitive result, we need another definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will call the proportion of the population that has the disease—the probability of contracting the disease—the <strong>prevalence</strong> (incidence) of a disease.</li>
</ul>
<div class="guidedpractice">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> be the event that an individual has the disease and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> be the event that an individual tests positive. How would you express each of the following quantities using probability notation?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>sensitivity</li>
<li>specificity</li>
<li>prevalence<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;1. sensitivity = &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(P(T | D)\)&lt;/span&gt;; 2. specificity = &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(P(T^C | D^C)\)&lt;/span&gt;; 3. prevalence = &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(P(D)\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>30</sup></a>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Note that sensitivity and specificity are conditional probabilities, while prevalence is an unconditional probability. While the above probabilities are useful information, if you test positive on a diagnostic test, none of these quantities is the probability you really want to know: the conditional probability of having the disease, given you tested positive, <span class="math inline">\(P(D | T)\)</span>.</p>
<div id="the-case-of-baby-jeff" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>The case of Baby Jeff<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-case-of-baby-jeff"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The following case study was presented by <span class="citation">Slawson and Shaughnessy (<a href="references.html#ref-bayes2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span>. A poster in a hospital’s newborn nursery announced that all male newborns would be screened for muscular dystrophy using a heel stick blood test for creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). The test characteristics of the screening tests were nearly perfect: a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 99.98%. The prevalence of muscular dystrophy in male newborns ranges from 1 in 3,500 to 1 in 15,000. Baby Jeff had an abnormal CPK test. The parents of the baby wanted to know, “What is the chance that our son has muscular dystrophy?” Doctors informed the parents that though not 100% likely, it was highly probable. First, take a minute and predict this probability – what do you think? 80% chance? 99% chance? Let’s investigate using a two-way table of a hypothetical population of 100,000 male newborns.</p>
<p>For our calculations, let’s use a prevalence of 1 in 10,000. Then out of 100,000 hypothetical male newborns, we would expect 1 in 10,000 to have muscular dystrophy, or 10: <span class="math inline">\((1/10000)\times 100000 = 10\)</span>. The sensitivity of the test is perfect, so all 10 of the male newborns with muscular dystrophy will test positive. Of the <span class="math inline">\(100000-10 = 99,990\)</span> male newborns that do not have muscular dystrophy, 99.98% will test negative: <span class="math inline">\((0.9998)\times 99990 = 99,970\)</span> infants. That leaves <span class="math inline">\(99990 - 99970 = 20\)</span> male newborns that test positive even though they do not have muscular dystrophy. This allows us to fill in the counts in our hypothetical two-way table:</p>
<div class="inline-table"><table class="table table-sm">
<thead><tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th align="left">Tests positive</th>
<th align="left">Tests negative</th>
<th align="left">Total</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Has muscular dystrophy</td>
<td align="left">10</td>
<td align="left">0</td>
<td align="left">10</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Does not have muscular dystrophy</td>
<td align="left">20</td>
<td align="left">99,970</td>
<td align="left">99,990</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Total</td>
<td align="left">30</td>
<td align="left">99,970</td>
<td align="left">100,000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
<p>Now we can read off the desired probability from the table: of the 30 male newborns we’d expect to test positive, only 10 of them actually have muscular dystrophy. This means the chance Baby Jeff has muscular dystrophy is only about 33%!</p>

<div class="guidedpractice">
How would this probability change if the prevalence were 1/3500? 1/15000? Try it.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;If the prevalence were 1/3500, the probability of actually having muscular dystrophy given that the baby tests positive is 0.588 (slightly better than just flipping a coin for a test!). With prevalence of 1/15000, this probability decreases to 0.250.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>31</sup></a>
</div>
<p>Why did this counter-intuitive result occur? With such high sensitivity and specificity, why does this test perform so poorly? The answer has to do with the prevalence of the disease. For a rare disease, the very small proportion that test positive out of the very large group of people without the disease will overwhelm the very large proportion that test positive out of the very small group of people with the disease. The number of false positives can be much higher than the number of true positives.</p>

</h2>
<p>In this section we will explore techniques for summarizing quantitative variables.
For example, consider the <code>loan_amount</code> variable from the <code>loan50</code> data set, which represents the loan size for all 50 loans in the data set.
This variable is quantitative since we can sensibly discuss the numerical difference of the size of two loans.
On the other hand, area codes and zip codes are not quantitative, but rather they are categorical variables.</p>
<p>Throughout this section and the next, we will apply these methods using the <code>loan50</code>, <code>county</code>, and <code>email50</code> data sets, which were introduced in Section <a href="intro-to-data.html#data-basics">1.2</a>.
If you’d like to review the variables from either data set, see Tables <a href="intro-to-data.html#tab:loan50Variables">1.4</a> and <a href="intro-to-data.html#tab:countyVariables">1.6</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>A <strong>scatterplot</strong> provides a case-by-case view of data for two quantitative variables.
In Figure <a href="intro-to-data.html#fig:county-multi-unit-homeownership">1.4</a>, a scatterplot was used to examine the homeownership rate against the fraction of housing units that were part of multi-unit properties (e.g. apartments) in the <code>county</code> data set.
Another scatterplot is shown in Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:loan50-amount-income">2.10</a>, comparing the total income of a borrower <code>total_income</code> and the amount they borrowed <code>loan_amount</code> for the <code>loan50</code> data set.
In any scatterplot, each point represents a single case.
Since there are 50 cases in <code>loan50</code>, there are 50 points in Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:loan50-amount-income">2.10</a>.</p>
<p>When examining scatterplots, we describe four features:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Form</strong> - If you were to trace the trend of the points,
would the trend be <em>linear</em> or <em>nonlinear</em>?</li>
<li>
<strong>Direction</strong> - As values on the <em>x</em>-axis increase, do the <em>y</em>-values
tend to increase (<em>positive direction</em>) or do they decrease (<em>negative direction</em>)?</li>
<li>
<strong>Strength</strong> - How closely do the points follow a trend?</li>
<li>
<strong>Unusual observations</strong> or <strong>outliers</strong>- Are there any unusual observations
that do not seem to match the overall pattern of the scatterplot?</li>

<p>Looking at Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:loan50-amount-income">2.10</a>, we see that there are many
borrowers with income below $100,000 on the left side of the graph, while there
are a handful of borrowers with income above $250,000. The loan amounts vary from
below $10,000 to around $40,000. The data seem to have a <em>linear</em> form, though
the relationship between the two variables is quite <em>weak</em>. The direction is
<em>positive</em>—as total income increases, the loan amount also tends to increase—and there may be a few unusual observations in the higher income range,
though since the relationship is weak, it is hard to tell.</p>

</div>
<p>The <strong>distribution</strong> of a variable is a description of the possible values
it takes and how frequently each value occurs. The <strong>mean</strong>, often called the <strong>average</strong>, is a common way to measure the center of a distribution of data.
To compute the mean interest rate of the 50 loans above, we add up all the interest rates and divide by the number of observations.</p>
<p>The sample mean is often labeled <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>.
The letter <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is being used as a generic placeholder for the variable and the bar over the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> communicates we’re looking at the average of that variable. In our example <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> would represent interest rate, and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> = 11.57%.
It is useful to think of the mean as the balancing point of the distribution<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;For
more practice with this concept of the mean as a balancing point, see this &lt;a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/summarizing-quantitative-data-ap/mean-median-more/a/mean-as-the-balancing-point"&gt;Khan Academy article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>34</sup></a>, and it’s shown as a triangle in Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:loan-int-rate-dotplot">2.12</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>loan50</code> data set represents a sample from a larger population of loans made through Lending Club.
We could compute a mean for this population in the same way as the sample mean.
However, the population mean has a special label: <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>.
The symbol <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the Greek letter <em>mu</em> and represents the average of all observations in the population.
Sometimes a subscript, such as <span class="math inline">\(_x\)</span>, is used to represent which variable the population mean refers to, e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\mu_x\)</span>.
Often times it is too expensive or time consuming to measure the population mean precisely, so we often estimate <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> using the sample mean, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>.</p>

<div class="pronunciation">

In Chapter <a href="inference-cat.html#inference-cat">5</a> and beyond, we will develop tools to characterize the accuracy of point estimates, like the sample mean. As you might have guessed, point estimates based on larger samples tend to be more accurate than those based on smaller samples.
</div>
<p>The mean is useful for making comparisons across different samples that may have different sample sizes because it allows us to rescale or standardize a metric into something more easily interpretable and comparable.</p>
<p>Suppose we would like to understand if a new drug is more effective at treating asthma attacks than the standard drug.
A trial of 1500 adults is set up, where 500 receive the new drug, and 1000 receive a standard drug in the control group:</p>

<p>Comparing the raw counts of 200 to 300 asthma attacks would make it appear that the new drug is better, but this is an artifact of the imbalanced group sizes.

<li>New drug: <span class="math inline">\(200 / 500 = 0.4\)</span> asthma attacks per patient</li>
<li>Standard drug: <span class="math inline">\(300 / 1000 = 0.3\)</span> asthma attacks per patient</li>

<p>The standard drug has a lower average number of asthma attacks per patient than the average in the treatment group.</p>

To do so, we might first think to take the mean of the per capita incomes across the 3,142 counties in the  data set. What would be a better approach?</p>
<hr>
<p>The <code>county</code> data set is special in that each county actually represents many individual people.
If we were to simply average across the <code>income</code> variable, we would be treating counties with 5,000 and 5,000,000 residents equally in the calculations.
Instead, we should compute the total income for each county, add up all the counties’ totals, and then divide by the number of people in all the counties.
If we completed these steps with the  data, we would find that the per capita income for the US is $30,861.
Had we computed the <em>simple</em> mean of per capita income across counties, the result would have been just $26,093!</p>

<p>Dot plots show the exact value for each observation. This is useful for small data sets, but they can become hard to read with larger samples. Rather than showing the value of each observation, we prefer to think of the value as belonging to a <em>bin</em>. For example, in the <code>loan50</code> data set, we created a table of counts for the number of loans with interest rates between 5.0% and 7.5%, then the number of loans with rates between 7.5% and 10.0%, and so on. Observations that fall on the boundary of a bin (e.g., 10.00%) are allocated to the lower bin. This tabulation is shown in Table <a href="eda.html#tab:binnedIntRateAmountTable">2.10</a>. These binned counts are plotted as bars in Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:loan50IntRateHist">2.13</a> into what is called a <strong>histogram</strong>, which resembles a more heavily binned version of the stacked dot plot shown in Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:loan-int-rate-dotplot">2.12</a>.</p>

<p>Histograms provide a view of the <strong>data density</strong>. Higher bars represent where the data are relatively more common, or
“dense.” For instance, there are many more loans with rates between 5% and 10% than loans with rates between 20% and 25% in the data set. The bars make it easy to see how the density of the data changes relative to the interest rate.</p>
<p>Histograms are especially convenient for understanding the shape of the data distribution. Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:loan50IntRateHist">2.13</a> suggests that most loans have rates under 15%, while only a handful of loans have rates above 20%. When data trail off to the right in this way and has a longer right <strong>tail</strong>, the shape is said to be <strong>right skewed</strong><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Other ways to describe data that are right skewed: skewed to the right, skewed to the high end, or skewed to the positive end.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Data sets with the reverse characteristic—a long, thinner tail to the left—are said to be <strong>left skewed</strong>. We also say that such a distribution has a long left tail. Data sets that show roughly equal trailing off in both directions are called <strong>symmetric</strong>.</p>

<div class="onebox">
When data trail off in one direction, the distribution has a <strong>long tail</strong>.
If a distribution has a long left tail, it is <strong>left skewed</strong> or <strong>negatively skewed</strong>.
If a distribution has a long right tail, it is <strong>right skewed</strong> or <strong>positively skewed</strong>.

Besides the mean (since it was labeled), what can you see in the dot plot in Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:loan-int-rate-dotplot">2.12</a> that you cannot see in the histogram in Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:loan50IntRateHist">2.13</a>?<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;The interest rates for individual loans.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>38</sup></a>
</div>
<p>In addition to looking at whether a distribution is skewed or symmetric, histograms can be used to identify modes. A <strong>mode</strong> is represented by a prominent peak in the distribution. There is only one prominent peak in the histogram of <code>interest_rate</code>.</p>
<p>A definition of <em>mode</em> sometimes taught in math classes is the value with the most occurrences in the data set. However, for many real-world data sets, it is common to have <em>no</em> observations with the same value in a data set, making this definition impractical in data analysis.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:singleBiMultiModalPlots">2.14</a> shows histograms that have one, two, or three prominent peaks. Such distributions are called <strong>unimodal</strong>, <strong>bimodal</strong>, and <strong>multimodal</strong>, respectively. Any distribution with more than two prominent peaks is called multimodal. Notice that there was one prominent peak in the unimodal distribution with a second less prominent peak that was not counted since it only differs from its neighboring bins by a few observations.</p>

<p>Another type of plot that is helpful for exploring the shape of a distribution is a smoothed histogram, called a <strong>density plot</strong>. A density plot will scale the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis so that the total area under the density curve is equal to one. This allows us to get a sense of what <em>proportion</em> of the data lie in a certain interval, rather than the <em>frequency</em> of data in the interval. We can change the scale of a histogram to plot proportions rather than frequencies, then overlay a density curve on this rescaled histogram, as seen in Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:loan50IntRateDens">2.15</a>.</p>

</h3>
<p>The mean was introduced as a method to describe the center of a data set, and <strong>variability</strong> in the data is also important. Here, we introduce two measures of variability: the variance and the standard deviation. Both of these are very useful in data analysis, even though their formulas are a bit tedious to calculate by hand. The standard deviation is the easier of the two to comprehend, and it roughly describes how far away the typical observation is from the mean.</p>
<p>We call the distance of an observation from its mean its <strong>deviation</strong>. Below are the deviations for the <span class="math inline">\(1^{st}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2^{nd}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(3^{rd}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(50^{th}\)</span> observations in the <code>interest_rate</code> variable:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ x_1 - \bar{x} = 10.9 - 11.57 = -0.67 \]</span> <span class="math display">\[ x_2 - \bar{x} = 9.92 - 11.57 = -1.65 \]</span> <span class="math display">\[ x_3 - \bar{x} = 26.3 - 11.57 = 14.73 \]</span> <span class="math display">\[ \vdots \]</span> <span class="math display">\[ x_{50} - \bar{x} = 6.08 - 11.57 = -5.49 \]</span></p>
<p>If we square these deviations and then take an average, the result is equal to the sample <strong>variance</strong>, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ s^2 = \frac{(-0.67)^2 + (-1.65)^2 + (14.73)^2 + \cdots + (-5.49)^2}{50 - 1} = \frac{0.45 + 2.72 + \cdots + 30.14}{49} = 25.52 \]</span></p>
<p>We divide by <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span>, rather than dividing by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, when computing a sample’s variance; there’s some mathematical nuance here, but the end result is that doing this makes this statistic slightly more reliable and useful.</p>
<p>Notice that squaring the deviations does two things. First, it makes large values relatively much larger. Second, it gets rid of any negative signs.</p>
<p>The <strong>standard deviation</strong> is defined as the square root of the variance:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ s = \sqrt{25.52} = 5.05 \]</span></p>
<p>While often omitted, a subscript of <span class="math inline">\(_x\)</span> may be added to the variance and standard deviation, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(s_x^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_x\)</span>, if it is useful as a reminder that these are the variance and standard deviation of the observations represented by <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span>.</p>

<div class="onebox">
<p><strong>Variance and standard deviation.</strong></p>
<p>The sample variance is the (near) average squared distance from the mean:
<span class="math display">\[
  s^2 = \frac{((x_1 - \bar{x})^2 + (x_2 - \bar{x})^2 + \cdots + (x_n - \bar{x})^2)}{n-1}
\]</span>
The sample standard deviation is the square root of the variance: <span class="math inline">\(s = \sqrt{s^2}\)</span>.</p>
The standard deviation is useful when considering how far the data are distributed from the mean.
<em>The standard deviation represents the typical deviation of observations from the mean.</em>
If the distribution is bell-shaped, about 70% of the data will be within one standard deviation of the mean and about 95% will be within two standard deviations.
However, these percentages do not necessarily hold for other shaped distributions!
</div>
<p>Like the mean, the population values for variance and standard deviation have special symbols: <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> for the variance and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> for the standard deviation.</p>

<hr>
The distribution of interest rates is unimodal and skewed to the high end. Many of the rates fall near the mean at 11.57%, and most fall within one standard deviation (5.05%) of the mean.
There are a few exceptionally large interest rates in the sample that are above 20%.

<p>Mathematically, if we denote the sample size by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, then</p>
<ul>
<li>if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is odd, the median is the <span class="math inline">\([(n+1)/2]^{th}\)</span> smallest value in the data set, and</li>

<p>The second step in building a box plot is drawing a rectangle to represent the middle 50% of the data.
The length of the the box is called the <strong>interquartile range</strong>, or <strong>IQR</strong> for short.
It, like the standard deviation, is a measure of variability in data.
The more variable the data, the larger the standard deviation and IQR tend to be.
The two boundaries of the box are called the <strong>first quartile</strong> (the <span class="math inline">\(25^{th}\)</span> percentile, i.e., 25% of the data fall below this value) and the <strong>third quartile</strong> (the <span class="math inline">\(75^{th}\)</span> percentile, i.e., 75% of the data fall below this value)  , and these are often labeled <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>, respectively<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;The first and third quartiles are called quartiles because, together with the median (the second quartile), these three values break the data into four groups of equal size–the lowest 25%, next lowest 25%, next lowest 25%, and highest 25%.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>Extending out from the box, the <strong>whiskers</strong> attempt to capture the data outside of the box.
The whiskers of a box plot reach to the minimum and the maximum values in the data, unless there are points that are considered unusually high or unusually low, which are identified as potential <strong>outliers</strong> by the box plot.
These are labeled with a dot on the box plot.
The purpose of labeling these points—instead of extending the whiskers to the minimum and maximum observed values—is to help identify any observations that appear to be unusually distant from the rest of the data.
There are a variety of formulas for determining whether a particular data point is considered an outlier, and different statistical software use different formulas.
A commonly used formula is that any value that is beyond <span class="math inline">\(1.5\times IQR\)</span>[While the choice of exactly 1.5 is arbitrary, it is the most commonly used value for box plots.] away from the box is considered an outlier.
In a sense, the box is like the body of the box plot and the whiskers are like its arms trying to reach the rest of the data, up to the outliers.</p>
<p>In Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:loan-int-rate-boxplot-dotplot">2.18</a>,
the upper whisker does not extend to the last two points, 24.85% and 26.3%, which are above
<span class="math inline">\(Q_3 + 1.5\times IQR\)</span>, and so it extends only to the last point below this limit.
The lower whisker stops at the minimum value in the data set, 5.31%, since there are no outliers on the lower end of the distribution.</p>

<div class="protip">
The whiskers extend to actual data points—not the limits for outliers. That is,
the values <span class="math inline">\(Q_1 - 1.5\times IQR\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q_3 + 1.5\times IQR\)</span> should not be shown
on the plot.

<p>As a review, when describing a scatterplot—the association between
two quantitative variables, we look for the four features:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Form</li>
<li>Direction</li>
<li>Strength</li>
<li>Outliers</li>
</ol>
<p>When asked to describe or compare univariate (single variable) quantitative distributions, we look for four features:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Center</li>
<li>Variability</li>
<li>Shape</li>
<li>Outliers</li>
</ol>
<p>We can compare quantitative distributions by using side-by-side box plots,
or stacked histograms or dot plots. Recall that the <code>loan50</code> data set represents a sample from a larger loan data set called <code>loans</code>.
This larger data set contains information on 10,000 loans made through Lending Club. Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:homeownership-interest-boxplots">2.19</a> examines the relationship between <code>homeownership</code>, which for the <code>loans</code> data can take a value of <code>rent</code>, <code>mortgage</code> (owns but has a mortgage), or <code>own</code>, and <code>interest_rate</code>. Note that <code>homeownership</code>
is a categorical variable and <code>interest_rate</code> is a quantitative variable.</p>

Figure 2.19: Side-by-side box plots of loan interest rates by homeownership category.
</p>
</div>
<p>We see immediately that some features are easier to discern in box plots, while others in histograms. Shape is shown more clearly in histograms, while center (as measured by the median) is easy to compare across groups in the side-by-side box plots.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-14" class="example"><strong>Example 2.9  </strong></span>Using Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:homeownership-interest-boxplots">2.19</a> write a few sentences comparing the distributions of loan amount
across the different homeownership categories.</p>
<hr>
<p>The median loan amount is higher for those with a mortgage (around $16,000) than for those who own or rent (around $12,000-$13,000). However, variability in loan amounts is similar across homeownership categories, with an IQR of around $15,000 and loans ranging from a few hundred dollars to $40,000. We see from the histograms that the distribution of loan amounts is skewed right for all three homeownership categories, which means the mean loan amount will be higher than the median loan amount. There are no apparent outliers in the mortgage category, but both the rent and own categories have outliers at $40,000.</p>
Besides center, variability, shape, and outliers, another interesting feature in these distributions is the result of rounding. Loan amounts in the data set are often rounded to the nearest 100, so we see spikes on these values in the histogram—something that is not evident in the box plots.

<p>The median and IQR are called <strong>robust statistics</strong> because extreme observations have little effect on their values—moving the most extreme value generally has little influence on these statistics.
On the other hand, the mean and standard deviation are more heavily influenced by changes in extreme observations, which can be important in some situations. Additionally, the mean tends to get pulled in the direction of a distribution’s skewness, while the skewness has little affect on the median.</p>

<div class="example">

The median and IQR are only sensitive to numbers near <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span>, the median, and <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>.
Since values in these regions are stable in the three data sets, the median and IQR estimates are also stable.

<hr>
Nearly all of the data fall into the left-most bin, and the extreme skew obscures many of the potentially interesting details in the data.
</div>
<p>There are some standard transformations that may be useful for strongly right skewed data where much of the data is positive but clustered near zero.
For instance, a plot of the logarithm (base 10) of county populations results in the new histogram in Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:county-pop-transform">2.21</a>.
This data is symmetric, and any potential outliers appear much less extreme than in the original data set.
By reigning in the outliers and extreme skew, transformations like this often make it easier to build statistical models against the data.</p>
<p>Transformations can also be applied to one or both variables in a scatterplot.
A scatterplot of the population change from 2010 to 2017 against the population in 2010 is shown in Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:county-pop-change-transform">2.22</a>.
In this first scatterplot, it’s hard to decipher any interesting patterns because the population variable is so strongly skewed.
However, if we apply a log<span class="math inline">\(_{10}\)</span> transformation to the population variable, as shown in
Figure <a href="eda.html#fig:county-pop-change-transform">2.22</a>, a positive association between the variables is revealed.
In fact, we may be interested in fitting a trend line to the data when we explore methods around fitting regression lines in Chapter <a href="cor-reg.html#cor-reg">3</a>.</p>

<p>Transformations other than the logarithm can be useful, too.
For instance, the square root (<span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\text{original observation}}\)</span>) and inverse (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\text{original observation}}\)</span>) are commonly used by data scientists.
Common goals in transforming data are to see the data structure differently, reduce skew, assist in modeling, or straighten a nonlinear relationship in a scatterplot.</p>

<p>The <code>county</code> data set offers many numerical variables that we could plot using dot plots, scatterplots, or box plots, but these miss the true nature of the data.
Rather, when we encounter geographic data, we should create an <strong>intensity map</strong>, where colors are used to show higher and lower values of a variable.
Figures <a href="eda.html#fig:county-intensity-map-poverty-unemp">2.23</a> and <a href="eda.html#fig:county-intensity-map-homeownership-median-income">2.24</a> show intensity maps for poverty rate in percent (<code>poverty</code>), unemployment rate (<code>unemployment_rate</code>), homeownership rate in percent (<code>homeownership</code>), and median household income (<code>median_hh_income</code>).
The color key indicates which colors correspond to which values.
The intensity maps are not generally very helpful for getting precise values in any given county, but they are very helpful for seeing geographic trends and generating interesting research questions or hypotheses.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-17" class="example"><strong>Example 2.12  </strong></span>What interesting features are evident in the poverty and unemployment rate intensity maps?</p>
<hr>
Poverty rates are evidently higher in a few locations.
Notably, the deep south shows higher poverty rates, as does much of Arizona and New Mexico.
High poverty rates are evident in the Mississippi flood plains a little north of New Orleans and also in a large section of Kentucky.
The unemployment rate follows similar trends, and we can see correspondence between the two
variables.
In fact, it makes sense for higher rates of unemployment to be closely related to poverty rates.
One observation that stands out when comparing the two maps: the poverty rate is much higher than the unemployment rate, meaning while many people may be working, they are not making enough to break out of poverty.

<p>In the field of statistics, summary measures that summarize a sample of data are called <strong>statistics</strong>. Numbers that summarize an entire population <strong>parameters</strong>. You can remember
this distinction by looking at the first letter of each term:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>S</em></strong>tatistics summarize <strong><em>S</em></strong>amples.<br><strong><em>P</em></strong>arameters summarize <strong><em>P</em></strong>opulations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We typically use Roman letters to symbolize statistics (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>), and Greek letters to symbolize parameters (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>).</p>

<p>We introduced the following terms in the chapter.
If you’re not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.
We are purposefully presenting them in alphabetical order, instead of in order of appearance, so they will be a little more challenging to locate.
However you should be able to easily spot them as <strong>bolded text</strong>.</p>

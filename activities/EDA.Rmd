## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Learning Outcomes

* 


The following dataset is from the Current Population Survey in 1985.  The following table summarizes the data.

## Vocabulary Review

1. What are the observational units?

\vspace{1in}

2.  Which variables are categorical?

\vspace{1in}

3.  Which variables are quantitative?

\vspace{1in}

A bar chart is used to plot a single categorical variable.  We can plot the counts for each category in a frequency bar chart and the proportion in each categorcy in a relative frequency bar chart. Here we will create a bar chart of the variable sector.

```{r}
cps <- read.csv("../data/cps.csv") #This will read in the dataset
cps$sector <- factor(cps$sector) #When a variable is categorical you need to set up as a factor?????reword
cps$sex <- factor(cps$sex)
```


```{r}
barchart(cps$sector, #This specifies the dataset and the variable
         horizontal = FALSE, #Turn the bars so they are vertical
         main = "Frequency Bar Chart of Sector", #Give your chart a title
         xlab = "Sector", #Label the x axis
         ylab = "Frequency", #Label the y axis 
         ) #change the color of the bars
```
3.  Which Sector has the largest number of people in it?

\vspace{1in}


```{r}
barplot(table(cps$sector)/nrow(cps), #divide the frequency counts by the total
        main = "Relative Frequency Bar Graph of Sector", #Give your chart a title
        xlab = "Sector", #Label the x axis
        ylab = "Relative Frequency", #Label the y axis 
)
```

4.  How does this plot differ from the plot above?

\vspace{1in}


To visually display two categorical variables we will use a segmented bar chart. 

\vspace{1in}

```{r}
plot(sex~sector #response~explanatory allows us to plot two variables
     , data = cps, main="Segmented Bar Chart of Sector by Sex" #Make sure to title your graph
     )
```

5.  Using the segmented bar chart, which sector has about the same proportion of males and females?

\vspace{1in}

To plot quantitative variables, we can use a histogram or boxplot. To create a histogram the variable is broken into bins on a set width. Each bin plots the frequency of each .....$ We will create a histogram of the variable education.

```{r}
hist(cps$educ, #dataset name and variable
     main = "Histogram of Education", 
     xlab = "Education Level")
```


6. What is the width of each bin?

\vspace{1in}


7. What is the most common level of Education?

\vspace{1in}

Side by side plots are created from a single categorical and single quantitative variable. The boxplot is created using the five number summary: 
* Minimum value
* Quartile 1 (Q1) - the value at the 25th percentile
* Median - the value at the 50th percentile
* Quaritle 3 (Q3) - the avlue at the 75th percentile
* Maximum value 
Outliers are values less than $Q_1 - 1.5*IQR$ and greater than $Q_3 + 1.5*IQR$ 

The boxplot of wage by sector is plotted using the code below.
```{r}
boxplot(wage~sector #response~explanatory 
        , data=cps, main = "Side by side Boxplot of Wage by Sector", 
        xlab = "Sector", ylab = "Wage")
```

8. Compare Service and Sales using the four characteristic to comparing distributions.

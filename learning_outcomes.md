# STAT 216 Learning Outcomes by Topic

## Data Literacy
- Describe the statistical investigation process
- Identify observational units, variables, and variable types in a statistical study
- Identify key elements of a statistical study from a research article or news story
- Determine whether statements in a research article or news story are
  supported by the study results
- Understand and explain the effects of multiple testing

- This is Stacey's line

## Study Design
- Explain the purpose of random sampling and its effect on scope of inference
- Explain the purpose of random assignment and its effect on scope of inference
- Identify whether a study is observational or an experiment
- Identify potential types of sampling bias in a study (selection, response, non-response)
- Identify confounding variables in observational studies and explain why they are confounding

## Probability
- Recognize and simulate probabilities as long-run frequencies
- Construct two-way tables and tree diagrams to evaluate
  marginal, joint, and conditional probabilities

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Identify and create appropriate summary statistics and plots
  given a data set or research question
- Interpret the following summary statistics in context:
  median, lower quartile, upper quartile,
  standard deviation, inter-quartile range,
  coefficient of determination, regression line slope
- Summary statistics for a single categorical variable: frequencies, relative frequencies
- Summary statistics for a single quantitative variable: mean, median,
  percentiles, standard deviation, inter-quartile range, range, 5-number summary
- Summary statistics for association between two quantitative variables:
  correlation, coefficient of determination (R-squared), regression line
- Plots for a single categorical variable: bar plot
- Plots for association between two categorical variables:
  segmented bar plot, mosaic plot
- Plots for a single quantitative variable:
  dotplot, histogram, boxplot, density plot
- Plots for association between two quantitative variables: scatterplot
- Plots for association between one quantitative and one categorical variable:
  side-by-side boxplots; stacked histograms, density plots or dotplots
- Multivariable plots (e.g., scatterplot with factor)
- Given a plot or set of plots, describe and compare the distribution(s)
  of a single quantitative variable
  (center, variability, shape, outliers)
- Given a plot or set of plots, describe the association between
  two quantitative variables
  (form, direction, strength, outliers)

## Statistical Inference

__General Inference Concepts__
- Identify the sample and population of interest
- Recognize the difference between statistics and parameters and their symbols
- Describe the scope of inference for a study
- Understand and quantify sampling variability
- Understand how different factors of a study (e.g., sample size) affect
  power, p-values and confidence intervals 
- Explain the difference between practical importance and statistical significance
- Identify the two possible explanations (one assuming the null hypothesis, and one assuming
  the alternative hypothesis) for a relationship seen in sample data
- Identify and describe in context the consequences of a Type I and Type II error
  
__The Five Scenarios__
1. One proportion
2. Difference in proportions
3. Paired mean difference (single mean)
4. Difference in means
5. Simple linear regression (slope and correlation)

For each of the five scenarios:
- Given a research question, construct the null and alternative hypotheses
  in words and using appropriate statistical symbols
- Describe and perform simulation-based hypothesis tests
- Calculate and carry-out theory-based hypothesis tests
- Interpret and evaluate a p-value
- Calculate and interpret a standardized statistic
- Construct and interpret a theory-based confidence interval
- Use a confidence interval to determine the conclusion of a hypothesis test

## Statistical Computing
- TODO
- Figuring it out!
- This is Jade's line.
